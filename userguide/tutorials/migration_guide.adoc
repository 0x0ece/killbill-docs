= Kill Bill Migration Guide

== Overview

This guide is intended to provide some guidelines for running migrations from an **existing billing system** to **Kill Bill**.
It is by no mean an exact recipe book to follow, but it provides some recommendations on how to do things (based on previous experiences) and highlight some specific areas of concern.

The assumption is there is already an internal or third party billing system in place:

* It receives some live traffic, and migration should not cause any downtime
* It contains existing state (subscriptions, invoices, ...) that need to be migrated without impacting customers
* It provides a UI for customer service (CS) use to handle customer tickets
* It provides state/data that is used by accounting/financial departments
* One or several systems in the company are interracting with that billing system through API calls or by ETLing data

The end goal of the migration is to make sure that we can unplug completely the old billing system and yet provide the same level of service (or better) for the customers and the various departments in the organization.

This is a fairly ambitious goal, which may require some tradeoffs and a gradual shutdwon of the old system.

== Strategy

Like most complicated projects, it make sense to cut the projects in separate stages and also look for any amount of simplifications. 

=== What Needs to be Migrated?

One must first decide on the data that must be migrated, so let's start by the minimum amount of data that needs to be migrated:

* **Account data**: All the customer info such as name, email, phone, address, ... pretty much everything that would fit on the Kill Bill `Account` table. If additional data needs to be kept one could use custom fields to add key-value paremeters attached to the account data.
* **Active Subscriptions**: In order for users to still be billed and receive service, those need to be migrated and in a way to allow to switch from one system to the next with no (minimum) impact/visibility. Also note that since we are looking at the minimal amount of data to migrate we can ignore the historical data associated to a given subscription (e.g we don't migrate downgrade or upgrade that happened in the past, only current state).

Other state such as non active subscriptions, past invoices, and payments *don't need* to be migrated to have the system function correctly, but **that data may still need to be available in some fashion**. By not migrating that data into Kill Bill, this simplifies the problem:

* **Non active subscriptions**: Migrating those means migrating more data; also it is often the case that the older the data the less 'clean' it is and the harder it is to migrate (associated `Plan` may not be active anymore, previous bugs from existing billing systems mauy create difficult data to migrate, ...). Also, while this is feasible, this does not add too much value unless one wants to also migrate past invoices
* **Past Invoices**: Those are difficult to migrate as such, because they can't simply be replayed by Kill Bill (if we were to migrate all subscriptions and let Kill Bill catch up with invoices the result would be a set of invoices not exactly identical to the original system (pro-ration logic would be different, catalog may have been configured slightly differently on old system and in Kill Bill,...) and so those would not be useful as they could not provide a real replacement for past invoices. Another strategy would be to insert them manually in the invoice table to make sure they exactly match, but then invoices and subscriptions would not correspond exactly and system would try to correct the state. Also such a strategy would require inserting data directly or providing custom endpoints to touch these tables, both of which are risky and error prone initiatives.
* **Past Payments**: Those are exactly similar to what we described for invoices. They need to match exactly past invoices and the same set of challenge exists here.

So, let's look at the use cases for this data, and see how we suggest one can simplify the problem:

* **Customer Use Case**: Customers may still need to access their old invoices and payments. Assuming this data is static one could keep those (past invoices and payments) outside of the pure Kill Bill tables (could be same database with additional tables, or entirely different database) and provide new apis they fetch existing invoices and payments by merging old data with the new one from Kill Bill. Now, keeping that data completely static is a challenge because customers may still require some invoice adjustements, payment refunds associated with this old data... A good strategy here is to keep the old system alive for a while after the migration has been completed and serve those invoices/payments from the old system, allowing to still make the changes from the old system. After a while (maybe a few months) there will be very few such adjustments to make on those old invoices/payments and that data can be fetched and served from a static source. Isolated cases where customers still require some changes associated with these old invoices/payments cannot be made anymore but customer could still be satisfied by generating invoice or payment credit. Finally Accounting/Finance departments would barely impacted because the number of such requests becomes very few. So finally the old system can be fully unplugged.

* **Finance/Acounting departement**: They will still require old invoice and payment data to run reports but it does not necessarily need to be part of Kill Bill. A good alternative is to provide some kind of a view that will merge both the old data (from old billing system) and the new data coming from Kill Bill. Again here the old data could be ETLed from old system as long as it is alive and then data could be materialized after it has been extinct.

=== How Does Migration Work?

==== Migration Cutover Dates

The first thing to discuss is the **cutOverDate**, that is the date at which Kill Bill starts handling requests. In fact, we made the assumption that the migration would happen on a live system (with no downtime), and that has two consequences:

* The first consequence is that there needs to be a point in time where **new accounts** will be created in Bill Bill. While this is not a migration data issue (because those new accounts would never see the old system, so there is no data to migrate), we still need to define when is that **newAccountCutOverDate**
* The second consequence is that because we will make that migration work with no downtime, it does not need to happen all at once. In fact we propose to migrate the existing accounts on a per account basis. That way each account is migrated independently of the other (and occasional failures can be investigated and retried). So we will have one **cutOverDate** per account.

So assuming we have N existing accounts to migrate, we end up one **newAccountCutOverDate** and N **cutOverDate**. We need to first move new accounts to Kill Bill before migrating any of the  existing accounts because:

* Only when old billing system stops accepting new accounts, can we evaluate how many existing accounts there are (N becomes fixed at this point),
* This allows to verify that Kill Bill works as expected before we start migrating data.

==== Migration Framework

The migration code consists in several pieces:

* Ability to make api calls to old billing system (may already exist in some form)
* Ability to make api calls to Kill Bill (mandatory to handle new accounts regardless of migration data)
* Ability to route traffic to one (or both system)
* Provide migration apis:
** Ability to set/get **newAccountCutOverDate** 
** Ability to migrate specific accounts (would set things like **cutOverDate** for that account)


The choice of where those pieces are implemented really depends on the current architecture of the system. For instance if the code interracting with the existing billing system is well isolated, those new functions could take place at this level (client side). Conversely, if there are many components already interracting with the existing billing system, it might make sense to provide a new proxy server that encapsulate all that logic and have thpse components go through that proxy (and from an implementation point of view that proxy server could live in the same webapp as Kill Bill and access some new tables in the same database). 

The figure below shows that the migration logic owns its own migration state. It is also able to make api calls to both old billing system and Kill Bill and provide an interface to the existing Billing&Payment Components (systems that currently interact with the old billing system). From a logical point of view, the migration logic has been shown in a seprate box, but again this could be implemented in various ways:

==== Migration State

As discussed previously, each existing account would be migrated independently from the others providing a small granularity (and avoiding a risky success/fail migration). It is also important to allow for a process that provides claririty on what failed and what succeeded and ability to restart things from where they failed. In essence migrating an account should be an idempotent process, so it it fails part way through, things can be resumed. In order to achieve that result, the Migration Framework should own a `migration` table with the following fields (obviously one could add/remove fields as needed):

* `account_key`: The unique identifier for the account to be migrated. Based on that key account data can be pulled from old billing system.
* `migration_state`: We will see later that migrating an account is not an atomic operation so this will hold where we are in the migration process for that account
* `created_date`: Date when we first attempted to start the migration
* `update_date`: Date when we last attempted to run the migration
* `cut_over_date`: Date the migration completed (equals to `update_date` when migration has completed). Any subsequent requests after that date would be redirected to Kill Bill.


== Pre-Requisites

Before we can dig into more details on how the migration works, it is important to be ready to migrate these accounts. The readiness is something to be defined on a case by case, but there are a few things that are pretty much mandatory in all cases:

=== Setting up Kill Bill

Migrating accounts to Kill Bill first implies that Kill Bill has been deployed and configured correctly. The point of that doc is not describe those steps (we have other http://docs.killbill.io/[docs] to explain that), but to go through a few items that require special care:

* Catalog Creation: The catalog should include all the `Plans` that were configured in the old billing system, so that subscription migration works. Special care should be made for billing alignements to ensure that customer ends up being billed at the same dates as they used to. Most probably the abstractions between the two worlds are slightly different (e.g in Kill Bill world we have the concept of a `PlanPhase` while in the old billing system each `PlanPhase` may correspond to different `Plan` or event implemented differently).

* Templates and Translations: Kill Bill allows to configure the system using templates (e.g. invoice html visible to customer) and for http://docs.killbill.io/0.16/internationalization.html[internationalization] (e.g translating plan names in different languages).

* Payment plugins: Kill Bill typically interracts with a payment gateway or processor through a http://docs.killbill.io/0.16/payment_plugin.html[playment plugin]. We already have quite a few tested integrations out there so the work is either to test one of our payment plugin or write a new one to integrate with the desired gateway/processor.

* Overdue Configuration: Often called dunning in billing system, this http://docs.killbill.io/0.16/overdue.html[feature] lets you control what is happening when customers don't pay. Note that there is no obligation to try reproducing exiting logic from old billing system if this one was not satisfactory as this will not directly impact migration. Instead it is advised to configure it to provide the desired results. This step could also be ommitted and postponed until the end of migration.

* Analytics: This also a good time to think about how financial reports will be computed. At this stage, one can become familiar with the data model and investigate how existing reports will be generated. Kill Bill also has an https://github.com/killbill/killbill-analytics-plugin[analytics plugin], which provides the following benefits:
** Denormalized tables (on which queries become easier to run)
** Ability to generate custom reports
** UI side for visulatization inside KAUI if needed


After the system has been configured, we recommend trying out creating subscriptions with all the plans defined in the catalog to check they work as expected (and verifying invoice generation, ...)

=== Behavioral Analysis

At this stage, the system has been setup (proper validated catalog, ...) and there was enough manual testing to provide confidence with the setup of the system. In the next stage, the behavioral analysis, we fork the stream of requests for new accounts to go both in the old billing system (because `t < newAccountCutOverDate`) and to a Kill Bill test deployment. 

This provides the following benefits:

1. It creates production-like data (actually, data is exactly like production except for fields such as CC number, names, ... that should be obfuscated). It can be used to start computing reports and bringing confidence to the C-level team that new system will provide similar type of data/results. We suggest to configure the system with a default payment plugin inside Kill Bill (to avoid any interraction with payment gateway). The reporting only happens on the subscriptions and invoices but this is enough to guarantee that system behaves correctly. 
2. It paves the way for the first stage of the migration where new accounts are directed towards Kill Bill

Regarding implementation, the forking of the stream can happen in the migration logic proxy. A good way to achieve this result is to write a servlet filter that forwards existing requests to old billing system but also call the matching Kill Bill endpoints.

Regarding numbers, one should not expect the same numbers because system will behave differently: Most existing billing system are batch oriented while Kill Bill is event-based, so timing will be very different. Invoicing will also likely vary due to pro-ration logic and potentially different billing alignements. However this is the right time to investigate differences so those are well understood and potentilaly corrected (e.g catalog issue, system configuration issue,..)

=== Redirecting New Accounts to Kill Bill

At this point we have a working Kill Bill system that was correctly configured. There is a clear path forward to provide business reports, so everything is in place to start accepting new accounts. This is `t = newAccountCutOverDate`. The migration framework is then modified to not fork the stream between old billing system and Kill Bill test instance but instead:

* New accounts are created in Kill Bill and subsequent requests for this account are also directed to Kill Bill
* Old accounts related requests are still forwarded to old billing system.

From an implementation point of view, the servlet filter is again a good place for this logic to happen: Given an incoming request, extract `ID` of the request (depending on the request, could be the `accountId`, a `subscriptionId`, ... ) and first fetch the matching object inside Kill Bill. If it exists, request is made to Kill Bill, and if not request is forwarded to old billing system.


== Running the Migration

=== Summary

The main idea it to provide a migration endpoint, implemented in the migration logic proxy,  that knows how to migrate each account individually. Each account migration is composed of several steps:

1. Create a an entry in the migration table. (`migration_state` = `INIT`)
2. Migrate account data. This is relatively easy and low risk. The work consists in pulling account data from old billing system and mapping that to the Kill Bill data model. As mentionned before, additionnal info could be added as custom fields on the Kill Bill created `Account` (e.g ID of the account in the old system). (`migration_state` = `ACCOUNT_MIGRATED`)
3. Setup `AUTO_INVOICING_OFF` for the `Account` to prevent the system to trigger invoices when we start migrating the subscriptions. (`migration_state` = `AUTO_INVOICING_OFF`)
4. Migrate active subscriptions. We will provide more detail in the next section on how that works, but the overall idea is to fetch all active subscriptions and create at the right date and using the right `Plan` in such a way that we get a clean cutover and avoid double billing. Also note that in a system where there are dependencies among subscriptions (e.g. ADD_ON subscriptions), special care should be made to migrate them in the right order. (`migration_state` = `SUBSCRIPTIONS_MIGRATED`)
5. Cancel all subscriptions in the old system at the right time (more detail in the next section). This is a fairly risky step because this changes the state in the old billing system. This is *not* a point of 'no-return' but a point when rollback becomes difficult. Needless to say that cancellation code for old billing system should have been tested carefully. (`migration_state` = `OLD_SUBSCRIPTIONS_CANCELLED`)
6. Remove `AUTO_INVOICING_OFF` for the `Account`. (`migration_state` = `MIGRATED`)

After `t >= newAccountCutOverDate`, the set of account is fixed in the old billing system. It becomes easy to get a reliable list of all accounts that should be migrated and use that as an input for the migration endpoint.

=== Subscriptions Migration

==== Catalog Mapping

We discussed in the Pre-Requisites section, the importance to build a Kill Bill catalog that will provide the same kind of products/plans than the one configured in the old billing system. In addition to the Kill Bill catalog we also need a **mapping layer** between the name of the plans defined in the old system and the name of the `Plan` in the Kill Bill catalog. At the time of the migration, the plan associated to the subscription in the old catalog becomes a key in that mapping table to chose the correct Kill Bill `Plan` to use to the creation of the subscription.


==== Billing Dates

Migrating the active subscriptions correctly is definitely one of the challenge of the migration process. Whether the billing happens in arrear or in advance, for each subscription there is a date up to which it was billed for. This date is referred to as the `chargedThroughDate`:

* When billing in advance, the `chargedThroughDate` is the date in the future where the next invoice will occur (charging for the next period). So `nextBillingDate` = `chargedThroughDate`
* When billing in arrear, the `chargedThroughDate` is the date in the past (or present) when it was last billed. So `nextBillingDate` = `chargedThroughDate` + 1 period (e.g 1 month)

A clean subscription migration implies that we stop the billing in the old system at the `currentBillingDate` (where `currentBillingDate` + 1 Period = `nextBillingDate`) and starts the billing in Kill Bill at the `nextBillingDate`. So how to achieve that result?

The first mandatory piece is to be able to extract those dates from the old billing system for each individual subscription attached to the account. In some billing systems, there is only some support to have a `billCycleDate` (`BCD`) at the account level (day of the month at which account is billed) and so that simplifies the problem. In some other cases different subscriptions can have their own individual schedules. Kill Bill supports all models through the use of billing alignments (and for reference, even a `SUBSCRIPTION_BUNDLE` alignment) defined in the catalog, so the starting point is to verify those alignments match the old system (this was part of the Pre-Requisites section).

So from a billing point of view, we want to cancel the old subscription at `currentBillingDate` and start (the billing of) the subscription at `nextBillingDate`.

==== Entitlement Dates

A naive migration strategy would be to start the subscription in Kill Bill at `nextBillingDate`. While this works from a billing point of view, this causes some issues when the customer makes some changes (upgrade, downgrade, cancellation,...) during the interval of time such that `cutOverDate` <= t < `nextBillingDate`: In that interval of time, the subscription would have a future startDate (= `nextBillingDate`) so immediate changes could not be applied.

So, we need to separate the date at which the subscription starts (`subscriptionStartDate`) and the date at which the invoicing starts: From an entitlement point of view, we could use the `cutOverDate` as the `subscriptionStartDate`, and this would work, but a better choice is to use the `originalSubscriptionStartDate` (date at which the subscription started in the old billing system). As far as entitlement goes, starting a subscription in the past is equivalent to starting it in the present, so using the Kill Bill `subscriptionStartDate` = `originalSubscriptionStartDate` solves the entitlement issue we mentionned above and preserve the `originalSubscriptionStartDate` of the subscription.

==== Summary for Migration Dates

Let's summarize, the discussion about dates using the diagram below:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/migration/migration_dates.png[align=center]

At t = `cutOverDate`, the account is being migrated and for each existing active subscription in the old billing system, the following happens:

1. We create a subscription with a starting date of `originalSubscriptionStartDate` (using the right `Plan`, we will discuss that in the next section)
2. We stop the billing by inserting http://killbill.io/blog/blockingstate-abstractions[`BlockingState`] events (one event at t = `originalSubscriptionStartDate` with `isBlockBilling=true` and one event at t = `nextBillingDate` with `isBlockBilling=false`)

Note that subscription apis to create subscription don't allow to specify different dates for billing and entitlement, so additional apis calls to insert the `BlockingState` are required. While less practical, this is not really an issue because at that stage we have set `AUTO_INVOICING_OFF` at the account level so nothing will happen and atomicity is not required.

==== Multi-Phase Plans

There is another concern we did not discuss yet when migrating subscriptions for multi-phase `Plans`. Kill Bill supports `Plans` with multiple `PlanPhases` (such as `TRIAL`, `DISCOUNT`, `EVERGREEN`). The old billing system may support that concept as well, or it could be that such concepts are implemented in an entirely different fashion:

* Use multiple subscriptions for each separate phase (hopefully those are linked by some mechanism otherwsie this is quite difficult to understand,
* Treat each phase as a upgrade/downgrade scenario (i.e move it to a different kind of plan)
* ...

There is obviously some amount of work to understand the old system's model, and how those will translate into Kill Bill 's catalog (again part of the Pre-Requisites stage). So, assuming we are migrating a subscription into Kill Bill using a multi-phase `Plan`, we have to be cautious with the entitlement alignments and make sure we end up on the right phase.

Assuming the subscription with 2 phase `Plan` (`TRIAL`=15 days, followed by `EVERGREEN`):
There are a few scenarios to consider:

1. At t=`cutOverDate`, the subscription is already in the `EVERGREEN` phase; in this case we need to make sure we start directly into that phase. Fortunately this is possible because the Kill Bill api to create subscription allows to specify on which phase to start (skipping previous phases).
2. At t=`cutOverDate`, the subscription is still in TRIAL => TODO: Unsupported unless we violate the `originalSubscriptionStartDate` 

==== Pending Subscription Changes

Some billing system will also allow to schedule future changes associated to a subscription (such as upgrading a subscription in the future or cancelling a subscription in the future,..). During migration it is important to keep track of those future changes. Fortunately this is fairly straight-forward using the Kill Bill apis to change Plan or cancel in the future,...
