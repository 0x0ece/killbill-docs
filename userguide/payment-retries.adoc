The Kill Bill payment code is responsible for retrying the failed payments in the following states:

* *PAYMENT_FAILURE*: There is a configuration parameter which specifies how many retries should happen for that state and what is the delay between each retry. The property *killbill.payment.retry.days* specifies a comma separated list of days specifying the delay between each retry. Note that if there is a configuration file specifying overdue states, one should arrange to align those payment retries with the overdue states. If after all the retries were made and the payment is still not successful both the last attempt and payment status transition to PAYMENT_FAILURE_ABORTED.
* *PLUGIN_FAILURE*: There are 3 configuration parameters which specify the retry strategy for that state. The property *killbill.payment.failure.retry.start.sec* specifies the number of seconds that should elapse before we do the first retry. The property *killbill.payment.failure.retry.multiplier* specifies the multiplier that should be applied in between each attempt to implement some exponential retry strategy. Finally the property *killbill.payment.failure.retry.max.attempts* specifies how many attempts should be retried in that state. If the payment keep stays in that state after we reached the maximum number of attempts, both the last attempt and payment status transition to PLUGIN_FAILURE_ABORTED.
* *AUTO_PAY_OFF*: All the attempts that were in AUTO_PAY_OFF will be retried when we remove the AUTO_PAY_OFF on the account.
