= Installation via Our Standalone AMI

== Overview

We provide a **1-click** option to deploy Kill Bill server, KAUI, and the mysql instance on one EC2 host. This option is extremely convenient to get started, but is really limited for production deployments, because the i/ the database runs on the same instance -- i.e if the instance crashes, the data is gone! -- and ii/ there is no redundancy at any level.

We also provide another AMI that can be used within the scope of a production deployment, where we rely on a separate enterprise-ready database (RDS), and a multi-node deployment.

=== One Node Deployment 

In order to get started as quick as possible we offer an AMI that also bundles the mysql database as part of the same image. This makes it very easy to get started, as this only requires the click of a button.

Running Kill Bill on AWS using our official AMI lets you deploy Kill Bill, Kaui and MySQL in a single EC2 instance. It is perfect for test environments or for small production deployments where high availability or scale are not a concern.

After launching the AMI you should have a setup that looks like the following:

In this model, the AMI comes with a running instance of `nginx` that acts as a reverse proxy and spreads the incoming traffic to either Kill Server or KAUI based on the incoming port.

In order to get started, follow the instructions below:

. Start the installation process by going to +++<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B083LYVG9H?ref=_ptnr_doc_" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B083LYVG9H?ref=_ptnr_doc_'); return false;">AWS Marketplace</a>+++: click *Continue to Subscribe* and accept Terms. You will need some AWS permissions `aws-marketplace:*` to click on the Subscribe button.
. After a few minutes, click *Continue to Configuration* and *Continue to Launch*

* Make sure you enable the `auto-assign `public IP:

* Make sure you open the ingress port `443`, and `8443` on your security group:

* Make sure you specify an existing known key-pair (for SSH access)

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/std-key-pair.png[align=center]


Upon success, once the instance is running, Kill Bill is running on port 8443 and Kaui on port 443.

You can log-in to Kaui by going to https://<INSTANCE_IP_>:443 (make sure your IP address can address this port, or add it to the security group as needed). Default credentials are: *admin/password*. The first few requests might be a bit slow as Kill Bill initializes itself.

Take a look at our http://docs.killbill.io/latest/getting_started.html#_using_kill_bill_with_kaui[Getting Started] guide for an introduction to Kaui.


=== Multi Nodes Deployments

For production deployments, allocating a separate RDS database instance and allowing multiple nodes to handle traffic behind a load balancer is the recommended option. In this model, we rely on AWS ELB to correctly spread the traffic among the various nodes, and also to route traffic to either  Kill Server or KAUI based on the incoming port. Note that such deployment option requires a bit more setup and so we also provide an (easier) way to deploy using https://docs.killbill.io/latest//aws-cf.html[CloudFormation templates]. However, the benefits of this option is that it provides more control in the deployment.

The steps are the following:

1. Setup of the RDS instance

You can chose any options that are `mysql` or `postgresql` compatible. Using Aurora (mysql) is probably a good choice.
Make sure to correctly setup your VPC, and subnets.

2. Start the instances

TODO Link to AMI instance

The steps are similar to the one described for the section `One Node Deployment` above, but in addition, when starting the instance, you will need to specify the properties associated with your RDS instance. In order to make it easy, we have created a `User data` template script, which will need to be edited to specify the real values:

```
#!/bin/bash

DB_PROPS="/var/tmp/db.props.$$"
KB_PROPS="/var/tmp/kb.props.$$"

cat <<_EOF > $DB_PROPS
#
# EDIT FOLLOWING DB PROPERTIES BELOW AS NEEDED
#
DB_SERVER=standalone-db-instance-1.cah16olm8gkg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306
DB_USER=admin
DB_PASSWORD=5Xn21rhxr3Km4jC7N7ol
KILLBILL_DB_NAME=killbill
KAUI_DB_NAME=kaui
_EOF

cat <<_EOF > $KB_PROPS
#
# EDIT FOLLOWING KB PROPERTIES BELOW AS NEEDED
#
org.killbill.dontexist=foo
_EOF

su -l -c "cd /var/lib/tomcat/bin && /var/lib/tomcat/bin/updateProperties.sh $DB_PROPS $KB_PROPS" tomcat
```

Specifying such user data script in the AWS UI is shown below:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/userdata.png[align=center]


Make sure that the security group for the EC2 instance also includes the security group for the RDS instance to ensure your EC2 instances can connect to RDS.


3. Add the ELB in front of the EC2 instances

== Configuration

=== SSL Certificates

We have configured `nginx` to listen to port `443` (and forward traffic to KAUI) and so by default accessing the service from a web browser will show a `Not Secure` site. In order to make the site secure, you will need to add a valid certificate. The easiest option to add the certificate is to rely on `Let’s Encrypt`, a Certificate Authority (CA) that provides an easy way to obtain and install free TLS/SSL certificates.

The steps to add the certifcate are fairly simple and rely on a tool called `cerbot`.

[1]. Verify `cerbot` is installed or install it

Our latest image should have `cerbot` by default, but if not this can be added using the following:

Note: Check our `TroubleShooting` section to see how to login to the EC2 machine

```
# As root sudo su -
sudo su -
# Install cerbot if not already present
add-apt-repository -y ppa:certbot/certbot
apt install -y python-certbot-nginx
```

[2]. Stop all services

`cerbot` will need to have access to port `80` and `443`

```
# Stop kaui
> service kaui stop
# Stop killbill
> service killbill stop
# Stop nginx
> service killbill nginx
```

Make sure your AWS security groups allow incoming traffic on port `80` and port `443` for all IPs 

[3]. Setup your domain’s CNAME Record to point to the public DNS of your EC2 instance.

Create a `CNAME` to map your public DNS -- e.g `https://ec2-18-234-168-57.compute-1.amazonaws.com` -- to a legit `CNAME`, otherwise `cerbot` will fail with the following error: `Error creating new order :: Cannot issue for "ec2-18-234-168-57.compute-1.amazonaws.com": The ACME server refuses to issue a certificate for this domain name, because it is forbidden by policy`

The configuration of your CNAME needs to happen from the UI of your domain provider (`Namecheap`, `Cloudflare`, ...)

[4]. Modify the nginx `killbill.conf` server sections

The `server_name` by default specifies `_`. Instead you need to replace this with your `CNAME`:

```
server {
    listen 443;
    server_name <CNAME>;

...
```

[5]. Run `certbot`

```
> sudo certbot --nginx -d <CNAME>
```

If successful you will see a message like:


```
...
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/standalone.killbill.io/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/standalone.killbill.io/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2020-05-11. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```

[6]. Restart all services

```
# Start nginx
> service killbill nginx
# Start killbill
> service killbill stop
# Start kaui
> service kaui stop
```

Note: You can edit your security groups and remove the `port` `80`, and also reduce the visibility for other ports by specifying a tighter range of incoming IPs.

The `Let's Encrypt` certifcates are only valid 90 days and will therefore neeed to be renewed. `certbot` will create a cron entry under `/etc/cron.d/certbot` to make this process transparent.

=== Kill Bill

Kill Bill global properties are defined in `/var/lib/killbill/config/killbill.properties`. This is where you can change the MySQL credentials for instance. Take a look at our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html[configuration guide] for more details.

This is also where you can change the default Kill Bill admin credentials: specify `org.killbill.security.shiroResourcePath=/var/lib/killbill/config/shiro.ini` and create the `shiro.ini` file accordingly (see our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[RBAC guide] for more details).

== TroubleShooting Section


After launching the EC2 instance, the full stack should come up, with all services enabled and running, that is:

* An nginx instance receiving traffic on port `443` and `8443`
* A instance of Kill Bill server listening on `127.0.0.1:8080` (and receiving external traffic through nginx on port `8443`)
* A instance of Kaui listening on `127.0.0.1:3000` (and receiving external traffic through nginx on port `443`)
* A local `mysql` server running on port `3306`

In this section, we will provide some tips to verify the health of the system, and what to do when things are not working

**SSH to EC2 Instances**

From the EC2 dashboard, in the instance `Description` tab, you can copy the public DNS, called `Public DNS (IPv4)`.
Then, using the private key you specified when creating the instance:

```
# SSH as ubuntu user
> ssh -i  <LOCATION_KEY>/<KEY_NAME>.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC_DNS>
# Move to tomcat user
> sudo su - tomcat
```

**Service Health**

All services are started using System V init scripts, and so the status of the service can be retrieved:

* Kill Bill server: `service killbill status`
* KAUI server: `service kaui status`
* Nginx server: `service nginx status`

Similarly one can `start`, `stop` the services using simalar command -- e.g `service kaui stop` to stop KAUI.

In order to verify the health of the Kill Bill server instance, you can issue the following commands:

* Healthcheck endpoint: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/healthcheck`
* System info: `curl -u admin:password http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/nodesInfo`

**Log Files**

Tomcat logs are under `/var/lib/tomcat/logs/`:

* KAUI logs: `/var/lib/tomcat/logs/kaui.out`
* Kill Bill server logs: `/var/lib/tomcat/logs/catalina.out`

Nginx logs can be found under `/var/log/nginx/`

* Access logs: `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
* Error logs: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

**System Diagnostics**

In order to get some support, the first thing we would require is some information about your deployment. We have created a `diagnostic` command for that effect:

```
# Login as 'tomcat'
> sudo su - tomcat
#
# Assume a 'bob/lazar' tenant
# Assume some credentials 'admin/password'
#
> kpm  diagnostic \
  --killbill-credentials=admin password \
  --bundles-dir=/var/lib/killbill/bundles \
  --database-name=killbill \
  --database-credentials=root root \
  --killbill-api-credentials=bob lazar \
  --kaui-web-path=/var/lib/tomcat/webapps2 \
  --killbill-url=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --database-host=127.0.0.1:3306

...
Diagnostic data exported under /tmp/killbill-diagnostics-20200213-23204-u93ah5/killbill-diagnostics-02-13-20.zip 
```

**Database**

In order to access the database, one can use the following command  `mysql -u root -proot`. There is one `killbill` and one `kaui` database created and used by the respective application


**Nginx**

The configuration files are located under `/etc/nginx/` -- e.g `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/killbill.conf`

== Upgrade steps

Note: you must switch to the `tomcat` user first in order to upgrade Kill Bill or Kaui (`sudo su - tomcat`).

The configuration file `/var/lib/killbill/kpm.yml` specifies the Kill Bill version (and its plugins) running on the instance. After updating this file with the new version(s), simply execute `$KPM_INSTALL_KB_CMD`, delete the cached directory `/var/lib/tomcat/webapps/ROOT` and restart the instance.

A similar process can be used for Kaui: update `/var/lib/kaui/kpm.yml`, run `$KPM_INSTALL_KAUI_CMD`, delete the cached directory `/var/lib/tomcat/webapps2/ROOT` and restart the instance.
