Let's assume you want to build a site similar to Amazon Prime, i.e. an e-commerce website which offers a shopping cart and where paying subscribers have extra benefits (discounts, free shipping, etc.). You want to accept both credit cards and PayPal as means of payment.

Note that we won't go into the details of building the actual website, we will assume you already have a front-end (Rails app, JSP webapp, etc.). Kill Bill will handle all subscriptions and payments as a separate service, and your application  will communicate with Kill Bill over HTTP APIs.
