In the sections below, we are presenting APIs to manage payment methods and payments operations. Those APIs have been built to be as generic as possible and because each plugin/gateway has its own specificities, they also need to take that into account:
* For each API, one can specify custom properties by using query parameters -- those query parameteres should be URL encoded.
* Kill Bill will deserialize the query parameters and pass them striaght to the plugin

This mechanism allows to pass information from the client of the API to the plugin, and all that is opaque to Kill Bill; for instance, in order to specify the following two plugin properties:

[source,bash]
----
{ "city" => "San Francisco, "billing_address" => "address[postcode]=94114" }
----

One would have to add the following query parameters:

[source,bash]
----
pluginProperty=San%3DFrancisco&pluginProperty=billing_address%3Daddress%5Bpostcode%5D%3D94114
----
