==== Overview

The Kill Bill entitlement system primarily offers an API for users to manage their subscriptions: The API allows a user to subscribe to a new product, change, pause, resume or cancel its existing subscriptions. Upon each of those API calls there are really two distincts set of operations that occur in the system:

* There is an entitlement change that occurs; for instance upon creation, the user gains access to what she subscribed for, or in the case of cancellation she loses its access. The primary goal of that API is to give great flexibility through the use of dates or entitlement policies as to when things should start/stop,... 
* As a consequence of the entitlement operation, the system will also calculate the changes that should occur on the billing side. It is important to understand that the entitlement operation has an impact on billing, so the two are connected, but they are not necessarily aligned.

The philosophy behind that API is that the user (of the API) should be able to drive the entitlement so that it matches exactly its needs and let the system computes the billing aspect based on the policies that were configured in the system. Example:

* First an administrator could configure Kill Bill to never generate credit for a particular product 'P'.
* A customer comes in, subscribes to that product, gets invoiced...
* At a later date the customer decides that he no longer wants to use the product 'P' and so he decides to cancel that subscription immediately. From an entitlement point of view, the end date is now and so, as soon as the call returns, the customer loses access to its product 'P'.
* However from a billing point of view, and because the administrator decided to configure the system that way, the end date will be calculated by the system to match the end date of the last period invoiced, also referred to as charged through date (CTD), and that way there is no generated credit for that cancellation.

So, as a general rule, the administrator deals with the billing policies, and the user of the API controls the detail of its entitlement(s). The entitlement system exposes abstractions that reflect that model:

* Entitlement: An Entitlement encapsulates all the information that pertains to the entitlement question. That is, when does the entitlement starts, stops, which product information is associated with that entitlement at a given time... A user of the API will be able to create/cancel or make change to its Entitlements. 
* Subscription: A Subscription is a meta abstraction that encapsulate the Entitlement and adds additonal billing information. It can be retrieved using the entitlement API to get additional (than pure entitlement) information.
* SubscriptionBundle: Subscriptions are always part of a SubscriptionBundle. This allows to group them together so that specific operations -- cancellation, change of plan-- on one Subscription may have an impact on the other in the same SubscriptionBundle. There can be at most one Subscription attached to a BASE Category in a SubscriptionBundle but there can be multiple ADD_ON Subscriptions in that same SubscriptionBundle. Typically this is used to make sure that any operation on the BASE Subscription will be reflected on the ADD_ON Susbcriptions in the same SubscriptionBundle. 

Previoulsy we layed out the general case where the user of the API controls the Entitlement and Kill Bill manages the billing aspect based on configuration policies. Some specific entitlement APIs also allow to override the billing policies if this is ever needed.

==== Alignments

The API allows to provide the following matrix of combinations:

On the horizontal line, we have the various entitlement (ENT) policies or requested cancel date; on the vertical we have the same policies/requested cancel date for the billing side (BILL):

The diagrams below summarize what happens when a cancellation occurs on a subscription that was billed in advance: 

* The green line shows the entitlement, and the red cross on that line shows the cancellation as seen by the customer; that is, once we hit the red cross the customer loses access to its entitlement. 
* The red portion below shows the current invoice; by default the customer was invoiced from the start of the period to the end of the period, also referred to as charged through date (CTD).  

While we see that in all cases, cancelling a subscription has both an impact on the entitlement and the billing side, but we also see that those two are not necerally aligned:
