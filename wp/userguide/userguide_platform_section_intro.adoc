This is the reference guide to get started with Kill Bill. Make sure to check out our /faq[FAQ] too.

Note: Kill Bill offers two sets of APIs.

In case you are using Kill Bill as a library in your Java application, you can use directly the Java APIs available https://github.com/killbill/killbill-api/tree/master/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing[here].

But in most cases, you will use Kill Bill as a standalone service, and you are going to communicate with it over HTTP(s), using the REST APIs.

We offer several client libraries with examples:

* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-java[Java library]
* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-ruby[Ruby library]
* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-php[PHP library]
* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-js[Node.js library]
* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-python[Python library]
