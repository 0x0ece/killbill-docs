Kill Bill supports multi-tenancy, meaning you can run multiple logical instances of Kill Bill with a single server and database. For example, say you own two online stores, each of them having different catalogs, users, etc. You could configure a tenant for each of them, which would make the data from one store invisible to the other.

In practice, a tenant is a simple attribute that Kill Bill tracks along each object in the database (accounts, subscriptions, invoices, etc.). When multi-tenancy is enabled, you would create an *api key* and *api password* for each tenant and specify them in via the headers *X-Killbill-ApiKey* and *X-Killbill-ApiSecret* respectfully in all REST calls. Kill Bill would then automatically look up the tenant associated with your api key as part of each request.

Note that the *api key* is unique across tenants, similar to the tenant id. Whereas your tenant id will never change, the *api key* can be updated (if it is compromised for example).

Multi-tenancy is an advanced feature. You can turn it off by setting *-Dkillbill.server.multitenant=false*. We suggest though that it you let it enabled and create a tenant even if you have a single use case for Kill Bill. That way, you will be able to add another tenant if need be later on (going from multi-tenancy disabled to multi-tenancy enabled is much harder and will involve manual and error prone data changes).
