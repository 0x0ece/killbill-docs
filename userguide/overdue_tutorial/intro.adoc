Kill Bill offers an `Overdue` (or also referred to as Dunning) feature, which is required for when users don't pay their bills. In those cases, the merchant needs to take some action and so the feature must be customizable. Note that the `Entitlement` and `Overdue` modules in Kill Bill are tied to each other and are there to manage the customer experience with regards to her subscription(s):

* The `Entitlement` module defines the behavior of the system when the user starts, cancels a subscription or make some change in an existing subscription. It controls the level of service received by the user (from no service at all to full service) after such an operation occured.
* The `Overdue` module is in charge of altering the customer experience when payments are not met, and that potentially includes some degradation or even cancelation of the service. The overdue state is defined at the account level, which means that if a user has multiple subscriptions, and an invoice associated with one of them has not been paid, the behavior of the system with regard to the overdue state will be global for all subscriptions.

The `Overdue` feature is implemented with a combination of:

* The Overdue module built-in in Kill Bill, whose behavior is driven by some xml configuration file
* The generation of system events (Overdue events) that be processed by custom plugins

The combination of those two allow for a flexible way to configure the behavior of the system.
