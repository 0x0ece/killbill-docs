This is the reference guide to get started with the payments subsystem in Kill Bill. Make sure to check out our main http://docs.kill-bill.org/userguide.html[userguide] and http://docs.kill-bill.org/faq.html[FAQ] too.

All of these examples use curl but check the already available client libraries in Java, Ruby, etc. before implementing your own!
