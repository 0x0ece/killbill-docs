[[deployment]]
== Deployment

When deploying Kill Bill to a production environment, you'll likely want to use your own container and deploy Kill Bill as a war. Below are instructions for various containers. If you're unsure which one to use and/or don't have any preference, we recommend Jetty.

=== Common steps

==== Download the latest version of Kill Bill server

Releases are available in Maven Central. Among other packaging formats, we provide a war with all dependencies. You can get the latest version http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.kill-bill.billing%22%20AND%20a%3A%22killbill-server%22%20AND%20l%3A%22jar-with-dependencies%22%20AND%20p%3A%22war%22[here] (download the *jar-with-dependencies.war* artifact).

==== Setup the database

Note: currently, only MySQL is supported for multi-nodes deployments.

Create the database killbill will use and apply the latest DDL schema, which can be found http://docs.kill-bill.org/schema.html[here].

[[kaui]]

== Kaui

Kill Bill itself doesn't provide a UI to manage your accounts and subscriptions. All interactions with the core platform is expected to be done via the REST API and/or the Java APIs (if you decide to embed Kill Bill).

http://github.com/killbill/killbill-admin-ui[Kaui] (the Kill Bill Admin UI) is a UI on top of Kill Bill. It is provided as a Rails mountable engine, so you can easily integrate it with existing internal tools in your company, or simply use it as a standalone application. Note that you don't have to use Kaui in order to use Kill Bill.  You can see some Kaui screen shots http://kill-bill.org/kaui.html[here].

Besides Rails, we provide modules for other Web Frameworks. For example, Drupal users may want to use the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-drupal-plugin[Kill Bill Drupal plugin] instead. Checkout our https://github.com/killbill/[GitHub] page for other alternatives.
