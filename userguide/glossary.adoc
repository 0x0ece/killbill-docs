*Account* - An object representing a customer account. It contains details about the customer such as name, address, email address, phone number etc.

*Bundle* - A bundle is a collection of subscriptions associated with a single service instance. For example, I might have a base subscription for my phone plus an addon that gives me cheap international dialing. Because both Subscriptions are associated with the one phone, they collected into a single bundle. An account may own several Bundles, each with one or more Subscriptions.  

*Catalog* - Catalogs describes the set of Products, Plans, Price Lists and Rules that are being made availabel to customers. A catalog lets Kill Bill know what is being offered for sale and how and how much to charge for it.

*Payment Method* - Payment methods store the details required for Kill Bill to trigger a payment. They represent things like credit cards, debit cards or Paypal accounts. Each account can have many Payment Methods and at most one Default Payment Method. Note that much of the representation of a Payment Method is plugin-specific and is actually stored by the Payment Plugin itself.

*Plan* - Plans are Catalog objects that define how a Product is to be paid for. They can have multiple phases (e.g. trial, discount, evergreen). The phase specifies the frequency of payment and the prices in multiple currencies. Each phase can have fixed and recurring prices associated with it. Each Product can have multiple Plans specifying different ways that the Product can be purchased (e.g. a monthly Plan and an annual Plan)

*Price list* - Price lists are collections of plans that might be associated with a particular program (e.g. an affiliate program or a discount program). A plan can be in many price lists. There must be a default price list that is used when no pricelist is specified. When a subscription changes plan, Catalog rules can be used to determine which Price list the new Plan should use.

*Product* - Products represent the product or service that the customer buys.

*Subscription* - A Subscription is a contract that associates an account with a plan and a specific start date. The subscription will trigger automated payments based on the terms of the plan.

*Tag* - Tag can be added to Accounts, Bundles or Subscriptions. There are two kinds: System Tags can impact the behaviour of the system, User Tags are for information only. System Tags include things like: AUTO_PAY_OFF or AUTO_BILLING_OFF. User Tags can be created through the admin UI and are used to identify collections of Users, Subscriptions or Bundles so that they can easily be found or reported on later.
