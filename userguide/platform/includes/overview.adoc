=== Kill Bill Platform

At its core, Kill Bill offers a flexible platform on which applications that require a high level of integrity, audit traces, and robustness can be developed. Currently there are two kind of applications that have been developed:

* http://killbill.io/subscription-billing[Billing System] to manage recurring/usage based subscriptions
* http://killbill.io/payments-platform/[Payment system] that integrate with various payment gateways, payment processors, fraud detection systems, ...

The *Billing System* relies on the *Payment System* to make payments but the *Payment System* also offers direct payment APIs and therefore can also be run as a standalone application.

Some of the features of the Kill Bill platform include:

* Core Foundations
** A plugin framework where custom plugins can be added to modify the behavior of the system, and/or interact with third party systems,
** A robust persistent event bus, that is used both internally and externally (events are visible to plugins)
** An auditing framework that keeps track of all the changes that occurred (who?, when?, what?)
** Authentication and RBAC support
* Core services (account management, invoicing, entitlement, dunning, ...) which are built and packaged as independent jars, each of which with its own APIs; those core services post a well defined set of events on the persistent bus which are then consumed by other core services or plugins.
* Plugins

Contrary to most billing solutions, Kill Bill is *not* a batch oriented system, but instead, it is driven by events occurring in the system (for example, the creation of a new subscription will create a new event that the invoicing core service will process and as result a new invoice may be created along with a new event, which the payment core service will then process, ...).

Kill Bill is traditionally packaged as a war and is therefore executed within a web container (for example Tomcat). It offers http://killbill.io/api/[REST APIs] to manage the state associated with accounts, subscriptions, invoices, payments, ... It also provides lower level (Java) APIs and can therefore be embedded as a library within a (Java) user application.

=== Documentation

Our documentation is targeted for different types of audience:

* Kill Bill Visitors: technical or non-technical folks interested to know more about what Kill Bill is about.
* Kill Bill Users: technical folks that are interested to evaluate the solution or are ready to deploy it.
* Kill Bill Developers: technical folks that are interested to contribute to the open-source project (often to enhance the platform to suit their own specific needs).

For the *Kill Bill Visitors*, we provide an overview of the product on our http://killbill.io[main web site], and also http://killbill.io/features[some more details about the features]. Check out this video also for a quick tour:

For the *Kill Bill Users*, we provide a set of:

* http://docs.killbill.io[user guides and tutorials],
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChXICgGipKvJbtzKfM1SNoQ[screencasts],
* Plugin-specific documentation in the GitHub plugin repository (via a `Readme` file). An example of such documentation can be seen for the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-avatax-plugin[Avatax plugin].

For the *Kill Bill Developers*, we also provide additional pages on our https://github.com/killbill/killbill/wiki[github wiki].

=== Where To Start?

This obviously depends on the type of audience, and also whether you are looking for a Billing System, or a Payment System.

If your goal is to get a sense of what Kill Bill provides, and assuming you are at least slightly technical, here is a good start:

1. Read through the user guides
2. Follow the 5' minutes http://docs.killbill.io/0.16/getting_started.html[Getting Started tutorial]
3. Gather your requirements and start prototyping a proof of concept. You will need to have a local instance of Kill Bill and you have the following choices:
** Use the released war (either self executable) or drop the war into your container
** Use one of our already built https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/killbill/killbill[Docker images]
** For mode advanced usage, you can also use the source code and rely on the https://github.com/killbill/killbill/blob/master/bin/start-server[start-server] script
4. Depending on your use case, you will need to configure your catalog, and develop/deploy plugins
