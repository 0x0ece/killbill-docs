Kill Bill configuration is done principally via Java system properties.

These can be set on the command line (e.g. `java -Dkey1=value1 -Dkey2=value2 -jar killbill-server-jetty-console.war`) or in special `killbill.properties` file (via `-Dorg.killbill.server.properties=file:///path/to/killbill.properties`). If you are using a custom `kpm.yml` configuration file, you can also set them under the `properties` sub-entry like https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/blob/master/docker/templates/killbill/latest/kpm.yml.erb[here].

Some properties are global to the system, and therefore will apply to all tenants. Others (such as Catalog and Overdue configuration, as well as Invoice templates and language translation resources) can also be configured on a per tenant basis.

Most properties are accessible to the plugins through https://github.com/killbill/killbill-platform/blob/master/osgi-bundles/libs/killbill/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/osgi/libs/killbill/OSGIConfigPropertiesService.java[OSGIConfigPropertiesService].

Some parts of the system also rely on additional configuration files. The caching layer for instance, which is based on http://ehcache.org/[EhCache], requires a specific https://github.com/killbill/killbill/blob/master/util/src/main/resources/ehcache.xml[xml configuration]. The location of the xml itself is specified via a system property though (`org.killbill.cache.config.location` in this case).
