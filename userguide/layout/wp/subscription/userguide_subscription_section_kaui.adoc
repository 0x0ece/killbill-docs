== Kaui

Kill Bill itself doesn't provide a UI to manage your accounts and subscriptions. All interactions with the core platform is expected to be done via the REST API and/or the Java APIs (if you decide to embed Kill Bill).

http://github.com/killbill/killbill-admin-ui[Kaui] (the Kill Bill Admin UI) is a UI on top of Kill Bill. It is provided as a Rails mountable engine, so you can easily integrate it with existing internal tools in your company, or simply use it as a standalone application. Note that you don't have to use Kaui in order to use Kill Bill.  You can see some Kaui screen shots http://kill-bill.org/kaui.html[here].

Besides Rails, we provide modules for other Web Frameworks. For example, Drupal users may want to use the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-drupal-plugin[Kill Bill Drupal plugin] instead. Checkout our https://github.com/killbill/[GitHub] page for other alternatives.
