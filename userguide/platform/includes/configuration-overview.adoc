Kill Bill configuration is done principally via Java System Properties. These can be set on the command line (e.g. `java -Dkey1=value1 -Dkey2=value2 -jar killbill-server-jetty-console.war`) or in Java Properties files (via `-Dorg.killbill.server.properties=file:///path/to/killbill.properties` or `start.ini` if you are using Jetty). Some containers use custom formats (for example, System Properties in GlassFish would be placed in `domains/domain1/config/domain.xml`), so please refer to your container documentation for more information.

The system properties are global to the system, and therefore will apply to all tenants. Those properties will also be accessible to the various plugins through a https://github.com/killbill/killbill-platform/blob/master/osgi-bundles/libs/killbill/src/main/java/org/killbill/killbill/osgi/libs/killbill/OSGIConfigPropertiesService.java[special interface].
Some parts of the system also rely on additional xml configuration. Currently, only the caching layer which is based on http://ehcache.org/[EhCache] requires such https://github.com/killbill/killbill/blob/master/util/src/main/resources/ehcache.xml[xml configuration]. The location of the xml itself is specified via a system property `org.killbill.cache.config.location`.

In addition to these global settings, the following is also available on a per tenant basis:

* Catalog configuration
* Overdue configuration
* Invoice templates, and language translation resources
