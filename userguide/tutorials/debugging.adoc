= Debugging tips

== Turning on DEBUG logging

Using `jconsole` (default port 8989), you can set at runtime the log level of specific classes and packages (look for  the `ch.qos.logback.classic:Name=default,Type=ch.qos.logback.classic.jmx.JMXConfigurator` MBean).

== Following tokens

To understand why a specific action was taken, it is often useful to follow tokens.

When invoking a JAX-RS (HTTP) API, a `userToken` is automatically generated. You can also specify your own token via the `X-Request-Id` HTTP header (it *must* be a UUID).

Once set, this token is:

* attached to the processing thread
* attached to SLF4J MDC context as `kb.userToken` and displayed by default in logs (`tok=`)
* passed to all APIs as `CallContext#getUserToken()`
* passed to internal bus events as `BusEvent#getUserToken()`
* passed to external bus events as `ExtBusEvent#getUserToken()`
* passed to future notifications as `userToken`

Note that when a notification is created, a `futureUserToken` is auto-generated. That `futureUserToken` becomes the `userToken` when the notification is dispatched.

You can search for these tokens in Kaui, on the _Queues_ screen, accessible from the tenant page or via the per-account sub-menu (you need to be logged-in as the Kaui root user).

== Seeking help

If all else fail, reach out to our https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/killbilling-users[mailing-list] for help (*do not open a Github issue*).

In your message, specify:

* What you are seeing and what you are expecting
* How to reproduce your scenario (cURL commands, code snippet, ...)
* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud[KPM] diagnostic output, e.g.

```
kpm diagnostic --killbill-api-credentials=bob lazar \
               --killbill-credentials=admin password \
               --killbill-url=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
