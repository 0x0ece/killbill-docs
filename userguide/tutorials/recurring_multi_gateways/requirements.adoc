We will assume:

* You have Ruby 2.1+ or JRuby 1.7.11+ installed. This requirement is only to simplify the installation using https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/tree/master/kpm[KPM]. Alternatively, you can install Kill Bill manually by following the http://killbill.io/userguide/platform-userguide/[userguide]
* You have http://curl.haxx.se/[cURL] installed. This is only to be able to run the examples from this tutorial. In practice, your application will use one of our http://killbill.io/userguide/[client libraries]
* You have MySQL installed and have created a killbill database
