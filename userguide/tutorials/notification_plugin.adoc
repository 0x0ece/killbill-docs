= Developing a Notification Plugin

== Overview

Notification plugins implement the `OSGIKillbillEventDispatcher.OSGIKillbillEventHandler` interface. Each Kill Bill event from the external message bus is dispatched to the `public void handleKillbillEvent(final ExtBusEvent killbillEvent)` method. Such plugins can be a great alternative to http://docs.killbill.io/latest/push_notifications.html[Push Notifications] in performance demanding environments.

== Retries

By default, if your plugin triggers a runtime exception, the event is redispatched right away up to 3 times (or as configured by the `org.killbill.notificationq.external.max.failure.retry` global property). In some cases, you may want to retry at a later time (if for example a third-party provider is down). To do so, your plugin can throw a `QueueRetryException` with your own retry schedule.

Because of such behavior, any plugin can trigger retries at any time: it is hence important that your listener is idempotent.
