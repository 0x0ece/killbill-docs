Kill Bill configuration is done principally via Java System Properties. These can be set on the command line (e.g. *java -Dkey1=value1 -Dkey2=value2 -jar killbill-server-jetty-console.war*) or in Java Properties files (e.g. *start.ini* if you are using Jetty). Some containers use custom formats (for example, System Properties in GlassFish would be placed in *domains/domain1/config/domain.xml*), please refer to your container documentation for more information.

Various specific subcomponents are configured using XML files, including:

* http://ehcache.org/[EhCache]
* Catalog
* Overdue

In this case, you would use System Properties to specify the path to the XML file. For example, set *-Dkillbill.catalog.uri=file:///Users/acme/catalog/AcmeCatalog.xml* to specify that the catalog configuration is located at */Users/acme/catalog/AcmeCatalog.xml*.

This page lists all the System Properties you can set in Kill Bill. For component specific configuration (e.g. catalog), see the appropriate sections in the User Manual.
