= How to integrate Kill Bill and Stripe end-to-end

=== Step 1: Install Docker

The recommended way of installing Docker and Docker Compose is via Docker's repositories, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks.

Select the appropriate instructions for your link:https://docs.docker.com/install/[preferred operating system].

=== Step 2:  Install Docker Compose

Select the appropriate instructions for your link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[preferred operating system].

=== Step 3:  Create a docker-compose.yaml file

In a terminal, type the following:

[source, bash]
----
$ mkdir killbill
$ cd killbill
----

With your favorite text editor, create a `+docker-compose.yaml+` file and reflect the following:

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.7'
volumes:
  db:
services:
  killbill:
    image: killbill/killbill:0.22.2
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - KILLBILL_DAO_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/killbill
      - KILLBILL_DAO_USER=root
      - KILLBILL_DAO_PASSWORD=killbill
  kaui:
    image: killbill/kaui:2.0.1
    ports:
      - "9090:8080"
    environment:
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/kaui
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_USER=root
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_PASSWORD=killbill
      - KAUI_KILLBILL_URL=http://killbill:8080
  db:
    image: killbill/mariadb:0.22
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: db
        target: /var/lib/mysql
    expose:
      - "3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=killbill
----

Note that you may have to change the link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/[version] of the yaml file you create, according to which version of Docker you are using.

Save the file, and run:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose up
----

The startup sequence lasts a couple of minutes.  You should see something like the following once it finishes:

If it takes a long time or if the container crashes, verify you have enough memory allocated to Docker. On a Mac for instance, go to Docker Desktop Preferences and set the Memory to 4GiB in the Advanced panel.

You may now access the following:

.Kaui UI
- http://127.0.0.1:9090 (username/password: admin/password)

.Kill Bill API
- http://127.0.0.1:8080

=== Step 4:  Add a new tenant 

Now, we need to add a new tenant.  

1.  At the top of the navigation panel, hover over the gear icon and select 'TENANTS.'

2.  Select the '+' icon next to Kaui Tenants.

.Enter the following information for the purpose of this tutorial:
- Name: bob
- API Key: bob
- API Secret: lazar

=== Step 5:  Create a new Sports product

After creating a new tenant, you should be brought to the following screen:

At the bottom of the screen, select the '+' icon next to Existing Plans to create a new product.

=== Step 5:  Create a Stripe account

Create an account at https://www.stripe.com.  Once you have logged in, give your account a name by clicking on "Add a name" under the Unnamed account drop-down in the upper left-hand corner.  A name is required for the Stripe integration.

Next, in the left panel, navigate to Developers > API Keys and click on "Reveal test key token."  You will need these keys once we configure the Stripe plugin for Kill Bill.

=== Step 6:  Create a Stripe account
