This is the reference guide to get started with Kill Bill. Make sure to check out our http://docs.kill-bill.org/faq.html[FAQ] too.

Note: Kill Bill offers two sets of APIs.

In case you are using Kill Bill as a library in your Java application, you can use directly the Java APIs available https://github.com/killbill/killbill-api/tree/master/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing[here].

But in most cases, you will use Kill Bill as a standalone service, and you are going to communicate with it over HTTP(s), using the REST APIs.

We offer several client libraries with examples:

* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-java[Java library]
* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-ruby[Ruby library]
* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-php[PHP library]
* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-js[Node.js library]
* http://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-python[Python library]

Below is a reference for all available resources. For more details and body parameters, follow the code https://github.com/killbill/killbill/tree/master/jaxrs/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/jaxrs/resources[here].

== Deployment

When deploying Kill Bill to a production environment, you'll likely want to use your own container and deploy Kill Bill as a war. Below are instructions for various containers. If you're unsure which one to use and/or don't have any preference, we recommend Jetty.

=== Common steps

==== Download the latest version of Kill Bill server

Releases are available in Maven Central. Among other packaging formats, we provide a war with all dependencies. You can get the latest version http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.kill-bill.billing%22%20AND%20a%3A%22killbill-profiles-killbill%22%20AND%20p%3A%22war%22[here] (download the *war* artifact).

==== Setup the database

Note: currently, only MySQL is supported for multi-nodes deployments.

Create the database killbill will use and apply the latest DDL schema, which can be found http://docs.kill-bill.org/schema.html[here].
