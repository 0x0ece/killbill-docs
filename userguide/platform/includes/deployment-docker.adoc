Deploying Kill Bill and Kaui through Docker is the recommended way for most users, as images abstract the complexity of setting up Java, a Webapp container, plugins, etc.

Make sure to get familiar with https://www.docker.com/[Docker] first, before attempting to install Kill Bill. The project has lots of great https://docs.docker.com/[docs] to help you get setup.

Documentation for our images is available https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/blob/master/docker/README.md[here]. Our http://killbill.io/blog/tag/docker/[blog] has also lots of tips on how to deploy to popular cloud providers.
