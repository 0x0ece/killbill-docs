In this tutorial, we will explore how we can deploy Kill Bill in AWS by leveraging the existing Docker killbill container.

The deployment will rely on:

* One EC2 instance where the killbill docker container runs
* One RDS instance for mysql

Requirements: **You need to create an AWS account and have an access to the AWS console**

Note that those steps are mostly for the purpose of a demo; they omit production-like features such as DB backup, Monitoring, or even deploying multiple EC2 instances for HA or horizontal scalability purpose. However, all those are more a matter of configuring AWS towards that end and spawning more instances, so in final, the steps can be used as *a basis* to deploy Kill Bill in the cloud to handle your production traffic.
