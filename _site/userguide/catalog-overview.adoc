The catalog is the central configuration object of Kill Bill for all of your Business rules. It contains what the customer buys (products), how the customer pays for a product (plans), change rules, prices, etc.

In practice, the catalog is an XML file (see an example https://github.com/killbill/killbill/blob/master/catalog/src/test/resources/SpyCarBasic.xml[here]). Please refer to the Catalog Configuration documentation to make Kill Bill use your own catalog.

The catalog is one of the most complex yet powerful tools provided by Kill Bill. See the links on the left to get you started on writing your own catalog.
