A payment is represented in Kill Bill with a payment row in the *payments* table; each time a payment is made the code will create a record in the *payment_attempts* table and update the *payment* record. Both the payment and the payment_attempt have a status. The payment status is the payment_attempt status of the last attempt except when the last payment_attempt is in an UNKNOWN state, in which case the payment status is the status of the last payment_attempt status not in UNKNOWN state; if there is only one attempt and it is in an UNKNOWN state, the payment status also shows an UNKNOWN state. The various state are:

* *SUCCESS*: The payment attempt succeeded. This is a terminal state.
* *UNKNOWN*: The payment attempt did not complete; for instance the system crashed while we were making the call; we are left in an unknown state. There is no automatic retry for that case, but if we issue another attempt manually, the system may heal itself.
* *AUTO_PAY_OFF*: The account associated with the payment is in AUTO_PAY_OFF and so any payment attempt made on that account will result in AUTO_PAY_OFF state.
* *PAYMENT_FAILURE*: The payment completed but failed because the payment method used to issue that payment is not valid.
* *PAYMENT_FAILURE_ABORTED*: The payment completed but failed because the payment method used to issue that payment is not valid. This case is similar to the previous one except it is a terminal state which occurs after we issued all the retries for that payment.
* *PLUGIN_FAILURE*: There was some exception coming back from the payment plugin. This state is similar to UNKNOWN in the sense we are left in an unknown state.
* *PLUGIN_FAILURE_ABORTED*: This state is similar to the previous one except this is terminal state, and there will be no more retries.
