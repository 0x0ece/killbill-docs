= Kill Bill Administrative UI

== Overview

Kill Bill itself doesn't provide a UI to manage your accounts and subscriptions. All interactions with the core platform is expected to be done via the REST API and/or the Java APIs (if you decide to embed Kill Bill).

We do provide however http://github.com/killbill/killbill-admin-ui-standalone[Kaui] (the Kill Bill Administrative UI): it is a self contained web application, interacting with Kill Bill over HTTP. Its primary purpose is for your support team to handle refunds, credits, cancellations, and adjustments. Additionally, it is also often used by the finance teams to record chargebacks.

Under the covers, Kaui is a series of Rails mountable engines. You can extend its functionality by mounting your own engine(s) (such as to provide a custom UI for your plugin(s)).

== Features

Kaui has been designed to be fully multi-tenant, which means you can deploy one UI to access all of your tenants. This http://killbill.io/blog/multi-tenancy-authorization/[blog post] explains in a bit more details on how that works.

Along with the multi-tenancy support, Kaui also leverages the authentication and authorization layer built into Kill Bill to restrict users from accessing some screens and actions depending on their permissions (such as refunding a payment, crediting an account, ...).

Additionally, Kaui is integrated with most of Kill Bill APIs and can:

* List all the accounts, bundles, invoices, payments, and allow to search based on various fields (account name, external key, email, ...)
* Account management
** Show contact info
** Show account balance, available credits, overdue status
** Manage existing payment methods
** List existing subscriptions and allow to create new ones, change plans, cancel subscriptions
** Tag management
* Account Timeline: visualize all the events through time associated with the account and allow specific filtering (subscription, event type, ...)

== Extensions

We provide extensions for some of the official plugins:

* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-analytics-ui[Analytics engine], which displays analytics graphs when the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-analytics-plugin[analytics plugin] has been deployed.
* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-avatax-ui[AvaTax engine], which lets you configure AvaTax when the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-avatax-plugin[AvaTax plugin] has been deployed.
* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-kpm-ui[KPM engine], which lets you configure KPM when the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-kpm-plugin[KPM plugin] has been deployed.

When you deploy the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-admin-ui-standalone[self contained war], these mountable engines are mounted by default.

== Screenshots

In this section we want to show a few screenshots to give a sense of what Kaui provides (and looks like). The data that we show is synthetic data that we generated using tests.

== Pagination of all Accounts (Per Tenant)

After the user has logged in and after choosing the tenant, the user can search for a specific account (if no search query is entered, a list of all accounts is displayed):

== Analytics

The Analytics screen will only be available when the analytics plugin has been deployed.

It lets you display custom metrics with filtering capabilities. We provide a few by default, but the analytics framework
lets you add any desired metric.

Here we show the MRR by plan over time:

== KPM

The KPM screen will only be available when the KPM plugin has been deployed.

It lets you install and uninstall plugins, as well as start/stop/restart them at runtime:
