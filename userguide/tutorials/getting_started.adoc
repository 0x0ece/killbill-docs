= Getting Started

== Installation

=== AWS

Already familiar with AWS? Running Kill Bill on AWS using our http://docs.killbill.io/latest/aws.html[One-Click installer] is the easiest and fastest way to get started.

=== Docker

You can run Kill Bill locally using our official Docker images.

If you are not yet familiar with Docker, take a look at the https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Get Started with Docker] guide. It is quite easy to get it up and running, and will greatly simplify the Kill Bill stack setup (Tomcat and MySQL configuration will be done for you).

First, make sure docker and docker-compose are https://docs.docker.com/install/[installed].

For example, on a Mac:

[source,bash]
----
brew install docker docker-compose
----

Or on Ubuntu:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose virtualbox
----

We will assume the Docker containers are accessible at 127.0.0.1 in the rest of this guide (if you are using docker-machine, you would need to retrieve the IP address of the Docker machine first).

Next, create a docker-compose.yml file similar to the one below:

> Note: You should https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/[change the version] in docker-compose.yml file according to your installed Docker version.

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.2'
volumes:
  db:
services:
  killbill:
    image: killbill/killbill:0.20.13
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - KILLBILL_DAO_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/killbill
      - KILLBILL_DAO_USER=root
      - KILLBILL_DAO_PASSWORD=killbill
  kaui:
    image: killbill/kaui:1.0.6
    ports:
      - "9090:8080"
    environment:
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/kaui
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_USER=root
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_PASSWORD=killbill
      - KAUI_KILLBILL_URL=http://killbill:8080
  db:
    image: killbill/mariadb:0.20
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: db
        target: /var/lib/mysql
    expose:
      - "3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=killbill
----

and run:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

3 containers will start:

* one for MariaDB (shared database, used by both Kill Bill and Kaui)
* one for Kill Bill (accessible on port 8080)
* one for Kaui (accessible on port 9090)

The startup sequence lasts a couple of minutes. It is ready when you see the message "INFO: Server startup". If it takes a long time or if the container crashes, verify you have enough memory allocated to Docker. On a Mac for instance, go to Docker Desktop Preferences and set the Memory to 4GiB in the Advanced panel.

You can now log-in to Kaui by going to http://127.0.0.1:9090. Default credentials are:

* username: admin
* password: password

You can also go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/api.html to explore our APIs.

== Using Kill Bill with Kaui

Go to http://127.0.0.1:9090[http://127.0.0.1:9090]. You will be prompted for a username and password. Both Kill Bill and Kaui support role based access control (RBAC), where you can configure fine-grained permissions for your users. The default set of credentials is `admin`/`password`, which grants full access.

Because Kill Bill supports multi-tenancy (where each tenant has its own data, configuration, etc.), the next step is to create your own tenant. We will assume the api key is `bob` and api secret `lazar` in the rest of this guide.

=== Modifying the Catalog

The Kill Bill *catalog* contains products and plans definitions. This XML configuration file is really powerful and offers various options for handling trials, add-ons, upgrades/downgrades, etc. For more details on its features, read the http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html[Subscription Billing manual].

For basic use cases, Kaui also lets you configure *simple* (subset of what is supported through XML configuration) plans through the UI, so you don't have to generate the catalog XML manually. This is available on your tenant configuration page, that you can access by clicking on your tenant name at the top right corner of every Kaui page.

For this tutorial, create 2 plans: *standard-free* (free plan) and *standard-monthly* (premium plan), associated with a single `Standard` product (the product category is `BASE`). We could have just defined standard-monthly, but that way you could make free users subscribe to the free plan. This is useful for reporting for example (to track how long it took to upsell them, etc.)

Note that we haven't defined any trial period.

=== Creating Your First Account

We will assume that users going to your site have to create an account in your system. When they do, you will need to create a mirrored *account* in Kill Bill.

To do so in Kaui, click the CREATE NEW ACCOUNT link at the top of the page.

Notes:

* The Kill Bill *External key* field should map to the unique id of the account in your system (should be unique and immutable). Kill Bill will auto-generate an id if you don't populate this field
* There are many more fields you can store (phone number, address, etc.) -- all of them are optional. Keep local regulations in mind though when populating these (PII laws, GDPR, etc.).

=== Adding a Payment Method

To trigger payments, Kill Bill will need to integrate with a payment provider (such as Stripe or PayPal). Each means of payment (e.g. a credit card) will have a *payment method* associated with it.

For simplicity in this tutorial, we will assume your customers send you checks. To create the payment method in Kaui, click the + next to Payment Methods on the main account page. The plugin name should be set to $$__EXTERNAL_PAYMENT__$$, leave all other fields blank and make sure the checkbox Default Payment Method is checked.

Once you are ready to integrate with a real payment processor, all you'll have to do is to create a new payment method for that account. The rest of this tutorial will still apply.

=== Creating Your First Subscription

Let's now try to subscribe a user to the Standard plan. This is the call that would need to be triggered from your website, when the user chooses the premium plan on the subscription checkout page.

In Kaui, click the Subscriptions tab then the + by *Subscription Bundles* (a subscription bundle is a collection, a _bundle_, of subscriptions, containing one base subscription and zero or more add-ons). Select the `standard-monthly` plan in the dropdown. You can also specify an optional (but unique) key to identify this subscription.

Because there is no trial period and because billing is performed in advance by default, Kill Bill will have automatically billed the user for the first month.

You should see the invoice and the payment by clicking on the Invoices and Payments tabs.

Kill Bill will now automatically charge the user on a monthly basis. You can estimate the amount which will be billed at a future date by triggering a dry-run invoice. On the main account page, in the Billing Info section, click the *Trigger invoice generation* wand (specify a date at least a month in the future).

== Using Kill Bill from Your App

Now that you are familiar with the basics, the next step is to integrate Kill Bill in your application using our APIs. Our https://killbill.github.io/slate/[API documentation] contains snippets to help you get started.

We also have lots of examples in our https://github.com/killbill/killbill-integration-tests[Ruby] and https://github.com/killbill/killbill/tree/master/profiles/killbill/src/test/java/org/killbill/billing/jaxrs[Java] integration tests.

For support along the way, do *not* open GitHub issues. Instead, reach out to our https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/killbilling-users[Google Groups].
