== General Information

=== Who are you?

Kill Bill is an open-source project which started at http://www.ning.com[Ning] in 2011. It is currently actively maintained by a group of https://github.com/orgs/killbill/members[core contributors].

You can follow our http://thekillbillstory.wordpress.com/[blog], to get insights on what the team is working on.

=== Where is the code?

All of our code is hosted on Github, in the https://github.com/killbill/[killbill] organization. The core of the Kill Bill platform can be found https://github.com/killbill/killbill[here].

=== How is Kill Bill different?

* Kill Bill is open-source
* Kill Bill has a pluggable architecture, allowing you to write plugins to extend or change default behaviors
* Kill Bill is not a batch system, but instead uses an event oriented architecture. http://thekillbillstory.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/kill-bill-billing-system-architecture/[Modules] share and react to events: for example, the invoice module sends an invoice creation event on the message bus whenever a new invoice is generated, to which the payment module reacts and triggers the actual payment. These events are available to plugins, so you can write custom logic the same way.

=== How mature is the project?

Kill Bill is currently running in production at http://www.ning.com[Ning] and has been invoicing millions of dollars and charging tens of thousands of credit cards over the past few years. We perform hundreds of tests before each release, and introduce regression tests when bugs are discovered.

Note though that Kill Bill is a platform to build billing systems. There are infinite combinations of configurations possible and we cannot test them all. Take also extra care when installing third-party plugins (only the plugins hosted on our https://github.com/killbill/[Github organization] are official supported).

=== How stable are your APIs?

We try to maintain backward compatibility as much as we can, but Kill Bill being an active projects, new APIs are frequently introduced to support new features. We provide official clients (https://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-ruby[Ruby], https://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-php[PHP], https://github.com/killbill/killbill-client-java[Java], etc.), so generally, you don't have to worry about it.

If you are a plugin maintainer and have questions regarding the API version you should be using, drop us a note on our https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/killbilling-users[mailing-list].

=== What kind of tests do you perform?

There are various levels of tests that we perform before each release:

* Unit tests
* Functional tests
* Java library integration tests (a.k.a beatrix)
* Server integration tests, to check the JAX-RS (REST) APIs.
* Client APIs integration tests

As of early 2014, we have over a thousand tests.

Most of our repositories are integrated with Travis. You can check the builds for the core platform https://travis-ci.org/killbill/killbill[here] for example.

=== Do you offer professional support?

We do! Please contact http://thebillingproject.com[The Billing Project] for all inquiries.

=== We are not a Java shop. Can we still use Kill Bill?

Yes! We try to hide most of the complexity so you can use simply Kill Bill as a service, using our client libraries. Currently, plugins can only be written in Java or Ruby though.

Check out our http://docs.kill-bill.org/userguide.html[userguide] for tutorials on how to deploy Kill Bill.

=== Where to start?

Our http://docs.kill-bill.org/userguide.html[userguide] has a 5' minute tutorial.


== Features

=== Is it only for recurring billing? Is usage billing supported?

The core of the platform is desgined as a recurring engine, but Kill Bill also supports usage billing and one-time transactions. Kill Bill is designed to be modular and most features can be turned on or off as you need.

Note that usage billing is a fairly large topic and we invite you to check out this http://thekillbillstory.wordpress.com/2014/03/11/usage-billing/[blog post] to understand the various types of usage. Currently, Kill Bill only supports Consumable in Arrear (in beta).

=== How do I insert my custom billing logic?

There are various ways of customizing Kill Bill. Besides http://docs.kill-bill.org/userguide.html#configuration[System Properties], which let you configure the core platform, most http://thekillbillstory.wordpress.com/2014/01/10/kill-bill-billing-system-architecture/[internal modules] have a second, more advanced, layer of configuration, usually through XML files. These let you configure the dunning (overdue) policy, the various plans and billing policies, etc.

If you need more advanced (billing or non-billing) logic, Kill Bill has a plugin capability. You can write custom code (in Java or Ruby) to extend or even override Kill Bill default behaviors. Check out our https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin[Java] and https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-ruby-plugin[Ruby] hello world plugins to get started.

Finally, Kill Bill is open-source! We are happy to accept contributions.

=== My customers are global, what is your internationalization support?

The core of the billing platform was designed to be internationalized. The catalog module has support for all currencies, including crypto-currencies (e.g. Bitcoin). The invoice module will understand these various currencies and respect localization rules. For example, it will correctly round US dollars to two decimal places but Japanese Yen amounts will have no decimal portion.

Accounts can have a designated locale (for example, $1,234.99 will be displayed as 1.234,99 $ for accounts with the French Canada locale) and timezone (to generate invoices in their timezone, instead of the merchant's).

From a payment perspective, Kill Bill supports payment gateways via plugins. If your international gateway isn't supported yet, you can simply write a plugin for it. Most of http://activemerchant.org/[Active Merchant] processors can be handled.

// === What is an entitlement? [Link to blog post]

=== What is a (subscription) bundle?

A bundle is a collection of subscriptions. A typical bundle has exactly one BASE subscription and a collecion of add-ons. Groupping logically these subscriptions together makes it easier to automatically cancel all add-ons when the BASE subscription is cancelled for example.

=== Can I create subscriptions without billing information?

Yes! If you are not ready to charge your customers (for example, during an activation phase), you can configure your plan with an initial free phase. Alternatively, you can set the AUTO_PAY_OFF tag to their account and Kill Bill will generate invoices but won't attempt to charge them. When you decide to remove this tag, payments will automatically occur.

=== Can I create an account without a subscription?

Absolutely! This can be useful during onboarding flows, if you need your customer in your CRM engine, databases, etc. but before she has actually signed-up.

=== What are the types of payment methods supported?

Kill Bill supports all credit and debit cards your payment gateway supports. Additionally, tracking of external payments (ACH, checks, cash, ...) is also a feature: when you receive the money, simply let Kill Bill know about it (either via our administrative UI or our APIs).

=== Are you PCI compliant?

Even if Kill Bill is used in PCI compliant companies today, it is your responsability to get certified. Depending on how you plan to use Kill Bill, you can outsource most of the PCI complexity to your payment gateway by not storing credit card information. Check the https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/merchants/self_assessment_form.php[PCI DSS] website for more information.

=== How can I secure my Kill Bill installation?

When running in production, make sure to enable SSL in your container of choice and use the role-based access control (RBAC) features that Kill Bill offers (only grant the minimum set of permissions your various users need).

=== Tax support?

Tax is currently not supported but this is on our roadmap.


== Operation

=== Does Kill Bill run in the cloud?

Kill Bill has successfully been deployed in private datacenters as well as in AWS, http://thekillbillstory.wordpress.com/2014/01/24/deploying-kill-bill-on-heroku/[Heroku] and http://thekillbillstory.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/deploying-kill-bill-on-openshift/[OpenShift].

We also provide scripts to ease the deployment story. Check out the http://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud[killbill-cloud] repo on Github.

=== What are the environment requirements?

This is a tough one to answer as it depends on the plugins you want to be running, your expected traffic, etc. If in doubt, send us your details on the https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/killbilling-users[mailing-list].


== Implementation questions

=== How can I listen to Kill Bill events?

You can either write a custom plugin and register it on the external bus (https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-ruby-plugin/blob/master/lib/helloworld.rb[Ruby example], https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldListener.java[Java example]) or register an endpoint that Kill Bill will send events to via HTTP POST (check the /1.0/kb/tenants/registerNotificationCallback resource).

=== How to get started with plugins?

See the http://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin[hello world Java] and http://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-ruby-plugin[hello world Ruby] plugins.
