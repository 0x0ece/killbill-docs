=============

Kill Bill documentation.

To generate the documentation locally, run ```make.sh```:

* generated html files are in the *build* directory
* you can open selfcontained guides in *build/selfcontained* with your browser
* *build/wp* contains individual sections which are published on killbill.io

Setup
-----

The scripts assume the asciidoctor gem (v 0.1.4) is installed: ```gem install asciidoctor -v 0.1.4```

Documentation on AsciiDoc can be found here: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/. A quick reference is available here: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/.
