Kill Bill maintains a reporting schema that is kept current in realtime for Analytics purposes. In contrary to other tables in the system, this set of tables is stable and potentially changes only between major revisions of Kill Bill. These tables are meant to be used as building blocks for reports and dashboards.

To distinguish them with Kill Bill objects, the Analytics objects are prefixed with the term *Business*, e.g. a Kill Bill account will have a representation in the Analytics subsystem by a Business Account object. For ease of tracking, Analytics objects contain id references to the Kill Bill ones but we strongly advise against using them for reporting purposes. Instead, use the external keys as much as possible, as they are tied to your business concepts. For instance, to count the number of accounts in the system, run a query using *count(distinct account_key)*, not *count(distinct account_id)*.

Data has been denormalized on purpose to avoid joins as much as possible.

All of this information is also available in Kaui (in the analytics section), on a per account basis.
