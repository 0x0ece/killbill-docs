=== Payment Method Flows Overview

When an end-user enters their payment details (like card information) into the merchant website, these payment details need to be saved in Kill Bill in order for Kill Bill to be able to process recurring payments. Additionally, the payment details may need to be saved within the payment gateway so that the end user does not have to enter their payment details each time. 

*Payment method flows* describe how a user's payment details gets added in Kill Bill and the payment gateway.

The end-user's payment details are referred to as a *payment method* in Kill Bill. The https://github.com/killbill/killbill-api/blob/4ae1c343a593de937415e21feecb9f5405037fa3/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/payment/api/PaymentApi.java#L541[PaymentApi#addPaymentMethod] is the entry point for saving a payment method in Kill Bill.

Kill Bill supports three main payment method flows as follows:

* Client side tokenization - In this case, the end user's payment details are converted into a token and sent to Kill Bill.

*  Hosted Payment Page Payment method flow - In this case, the merchant website redirects the end-user to a page on the payment gateway which collects the payment details. Kill Bill then performs a call to the payment gateway to obtain the payment method details.

The flow diagrams below explain the different ways in which a payment method can be added in Kill Bill. We consider the following actors:

* *Browser*: user sitting behind a browser and initiating the payment method flow

* *Merchant Site*: customer facing web site which receives the order

* *Kill Bill* - The Kill Bill system

* *Checkout Servlet* - Servlet that initiates setting up the payment method. 

* *Payment Plugin*: https://docs.killbill.io/latest/payment_plugin.html[Payment plugin] corresponding to the payment gateway 

* *Payment Gateway*: Entity that processes the payment

=== Client-side Tokenization Payment Method Flow

In this case, the merchant website collects the end-user's payment details. These are then converted into a token via a payment gateway specific Javascript which is embedded into the payment page on the merchant site. This token is sent to Kill Bill and Kill Bill charges the customer against the token.

The following diagram explains this payment method flow:

. The end user enters payment details on the merchant website.

. The merchant website converts it into a token and invokes the `addPaymentMethod` in Kill Bill with this token. This saves the token in the Kill Bill database.

. Kill Bill may optionally invoke the `addPaymentMethod` in the payment plugin corresponding to the payment gateway. 

. The payment plugin then makes a gateway specific call to save the payment token within the gateway so that the end user does not have to enter payment details each time.

=== Hosted Payment Page Payment Method Flow

Sometimes, a merchant site may not provide a payment form/may not want to collect payment data and tokenize it. In such cases, the merchant site can redirect a user to a payment page hosted by the payment gateway. Once the end-user enters his/her payment details on this page, the merchant site invokes Kill Bill to add the payment method. Kill Bill then performs another gateway specific call to retrieve the payment details which get saved in the Kill Bill database. Kill Bill then uses this information to charge the customer.

Thus, in such cases, a merchant site needs to perform a two-step process. In the first step, it needs to invoke Kill Bill to obtain the URL to redirect the user to and in the second step it needs to invoke the addPaymentMethod.

The following diagram explains this payment method flow:

. The end user initiates the check out process.

. The merchant website invokes a checkout servlet in Kill Bill. 

. Kill Bill invokes the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-api/blob/d9eca5af0e37541069b1c608f95e100dbe13b301/payment/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/payment/plugin/api/PaymentPluginApi.java#L269[PaymentPluginApi#buildFormDescriptor] method in the payment plugin. 

. The `PaymentPlugin#buildFormDescriptor` method makes a gateway specific call and obtains a redirect URL.

. The merchant website redirects the end user to this URL.

. The end user enters payment details on this page.

. If successful, the payment gateway redirects the user to a success URL on the merchant site.

. The merchant site then invokes the `KillBill#addPaymentMethod`

. Kill Bill in turn invokes the `PaymentPlugin#addPaymentMethod`.

. The `PaymentPlugin#addPaymentMethod` performs a gateway specific call and obtains a gateway specific payment method id. This is saved in the Kill Bill database. 

. The `PaymentPlugin#addPaymentMethod` may also perform a gateway specific call to save the payment method in the gateway as well so that the end user does not have to enter payment details each time.

=== Server-side Tokenization Payment Method Flow

Sometimes, a merchant site may collect the card details from the end-user and send them to Kill Bill. In this case, Kill Bill makes a call to the payment gateway to tokenize the card information. However, this approach is used very rarely as this requires a merchant website to be PCI Level 1 compliant.

The following diagram explains the payment method flow for this:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/payment-userguide/serverside-tokenization-payment-method-flow.png[align=center]

. The end user enters payment details on the merchant website

. The merchant website invokes the `addPaymentMethod` in Kill Bill with the payment details. 

. Kill Bill invokes the `addPaymentMethod` in the payment plugin corresponding to the payment gateway. 

. The payment plugin then makes a gateway specific call to save the payment details and returns a  token. This is saved within Kill Bill as well as the payment gateway
