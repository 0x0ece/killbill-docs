= Kill Bill on AWS

== Introduction

The core development team publishes official images on the AWS Marketplace, which lets you quickly get started with Kill Bill in the cloud.

== Installation via Our Standalone AMI

Running Kill Bill on AWS using our official AMI lets you deploy Kill Bill, Kaui and MySQL in a single EC2 instance. It is perfect for test environments or for small production deployments where high availability isn't a concern.

After launching the AMI you should have a setup that looks like the following:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/standalone_deployment.png[align=center]


=== Setup Steps

. Start the installation process by going to +++<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B083LYVG9H?ref=_ptnr_doc_" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B083LYVG9H?ref=_ptnr_doc_'); return false;">AWS Marketplace</a>+++: click *Continue to Subscribe* and accept Terms. You will need some AWS permissions `aws-marketplace:*` to click on the Subscribe button.
. After a few minutes, click *Continue to Configuration* and *Continue to Launch*

* Make sure you enable the `auto-assign `public IP:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/std-enable-public-ip.png[align=center]

* Make sure you open the ingress port `443`, and `8443` on your security group:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/std-security-group.png[align=center]

* Make sure you specify an existing known key-pair (for SSH access)

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/std-key-pair.png[align=center]


Upon success, once the instance is running, Kill Bill is running on port 8443 and Kaui on port 443.


You can log-in to Kaui by going to https://<INSTANCE_IP_>:443 (make sure your IP address can address this port, or add it to the security group as needed). Default credentials are: *admin/password*. The first few requests might be a bit slow as Kill Bill initializes itself.

Take a look at our http://docs.killbill.io/latest/getting_started.html#_using_kill_bill_with_kaui[Getting Started] guide for an introduction to Kaui.

=== Configuration

=== SSL Certificates

We have configured `nginx` to listen to port `443` (and forward traffic to KAUI) and so by default accessing the service from a web browser will show a `Not Secure` site. In order to make the site secure, you will need to add a valid certificate. The easiest option to add the certificate is to rely on `Let’s Encrypt`, a Certificate Authority (CA) that provides an easy way to obtain and install free TLS/SSL certificates.

The steps to add the certifcate are fairly simple and rely on a tool called `cerbot`.

[1]. Verify `cerbot` is installed or install it

Our latest image should have `cerbot` by default, but if not this can be added using the following:

Note: Check our `TroubleShooting` section to see how to login to the EC2 machine

```
# As root sudo su -
sudo su -
# Install cerbot if not already present
add-apt-repository -y ppa:certbot/certbot
apt install -y python-certbot-nginx
```

[2]. Stop all services

`cerbot` will need to have access to port `80` and `443`

```
# Stop kaui
> service kaui stop
# Stop killbill
> service killbill stop
# Stop nginx
> service killbill nginx
```

Make sure your AWS security groups allow incoming traffic on port `80` and port `443` for all IPs 

[3]. Setup your domain’s CNAME Record to point to the public DNS of your EC2 instance.

Create a `CNAME` to map your public DNS -- e.g `https://ec2-18-234-168-57.compute-1.amazonaws.com` -- to a legit `CNAME`, otherwise `cerbot` will fail with the following error: `Error creating new order :: Cannot issue for "ec2-18-234-168-57.compute-1.amazonaws.com": The ACME server refuses to issue a certificate for this domain name, because it is forbidden by policy`

The configuration of your CNAME needs to happen from the UI of your domain provider (`Namecheap`, `Cloudflare`, ...)

[4]. Modify the nginx `killbill.conf` server sections

The `server_name` by default specifies `_`. Instead you need to replace this with your `CNAME`:

```
server {
    listen 443;
    server_name <CNAME>;

...
```

[5]. Run `certbot`

```
> sudo certbot --nginx -d <CNAME>
```

If successful you will see a message like:


```
...
IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/standalone.killbill.io/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/standalone.killbill.io/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2020-05-11. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le
```

[6]. Restart all services

```
# Start nginx
> service killbill nginx
# Start killbill
> service killbill stop
# Start kaui
> service kaui stop
```

Note: You can edit your security groups and remove the `port` `80`, and also reduce the visibility for other ports by specifying a tighter range of incoming IPs.

The `Let's Encrypt` certifcates are only valid 90 days and will therefore neeed to be renewed. `certbot` will create a cron entry under `/etc/cron.d/certbot` to make this process transparent.

=== Kill Bill

Kill Bill global properties are defined in `/var/lib/killbill/config/killbill.properties`. This is where you can change the MySQL credentials for instance. Take a look at our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html[configuration guide] for more details.

This is also where you can change the default Kill Bill admin credentials: specify `org.killbill.security.shiroResourcePath=/var/lib/killbill/config/shiro.ini` and create the `shiro.ini` file accordingly (see our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[RBAC guide] for more details).

=== TroubleShooting Section


After launching the EC2 instance, the full stack should come up, with all services enabled and running, that is:

* An nginx instance receiving traffic on port `443` and `8443`
* A instance of Kill Bill server listening on `127.0.0.1:8080` (and receiving external traffic through nginx on port `8443`)
* A instance of Kaui listening on `127.0.0.1:3000` (and receiving external traffic through nginx on port `443`)
* A local `mysql` server running on port `3306`

In this section, we will provide some tips to verify the health of the system, and what to do when things are not working

**SSH to EC2 Instances**

From the EC2 dashboard, in the instance `Description` tab, you can copy the public DNS, called `Public DNS (IPv4)`.
Then, using the private key you specified when creating the instance:

```
# SSH as ubuntu user
> ssh -i  <LOCATION_KEY>/<KEY_NAME>.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC_DNS>
# Move to tomcat user
> sudo su - tomcat
```

**Service Health**

All services are started using System V init scripts, and so the status of the service can be retrieved:

* Kill Bill server: `service killbill status`
* KAUI server: `service kaui status`
* Nginx server: `service nginx status`

Similarly one can `start`, `stop` the services using simalar command -- e.g `service kaui stop` to stop KAUI.

In order to verify the health of the Kill Bill server instance, you can issue the following commands:

* Healthcheck endpoint: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/healthcheck`
* System info: `curl -u admin:password http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/nodesInfo`

**Log Files**

Tomcat logs are under `/var/lib/tomcat/logs/`:

* KAUI logs: `/var/lib/tomcat/logs/kaui.out`
* Kill Bill server logs: `/var/lib/tomcat/logs/catalina.out`

Nginx logs can be found under `/var/log/nginx/`

* Access logs: `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
* Error logs: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

**Database**

In order to access the database, one can use the following command  `mysql -u root -proot`. There is one `killbill` and one `kaui` database created and used by the respective application


**Nginx**

The configuration files are located under `/etc/nginx/` -- e.g `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/killbill.conf`

=== Upgrade steps

Note: you must switch to the `tomcat` user first in order to upgrade Kill Bill or Kaui (`sudo su - tomcat`).

The configuration file `/var/lib/killbill/kpm.yml` specifies the Kill Bill version (and its plugins) running on the instance. After updating this file with the new version(s), simply execute `$KPM_INSTALL_KB_CMD`, delete the cached directory `/var/lib/tomcat/webapps/ROOT` and restart the instance.

A similar process can be used for Kaui: update `/var/lib/kaui/kpm.yml`, run `$KPM_INSTALL_KAUI_CMD`, delete the cached directory `/var/lib/tomcat/webapps2/ROOT` and restart the instance.


== Installation via CloudFormation

The Standalone AMIs are very convenient to start a full stack on ONE EC2 instance, but for production deployments, we suggest to use our CloudFormation tempate to start a fully redundant stack.

=== Overview of the Stack

Running Kill Bill on AWS using our +++<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nochv5omslmds?ref=_ptnr_doc_" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nochv5omslmds?ref=_ptnr_doc_'); return false;">official CloudFormation template</a>+++ is the easiest and fastest way to get started with a production cluster. *It is also the only method of installation that is certified by the core developers for a Highly Available, horizontally scalable and production-ready installation.*

With the click of a button, the template will install and configure:

* Kill Bill and Kaui on a custom AMI optimized for AWS workloads (integrated with CloudWatch, SQS, SES, X-Ray and more)
* Auto Scaling Groups, to automatically scale up and down the number of instances as needed (such as when batches of invoices are generated)
* A load balancer, integrated with our internal healthchecks to promptly take out of rotation unhealthy instances
* A RDS Aurora Cluster with automatic failover


The following diagram shows the various AWS entities that will be created by CloudFormation:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/cf_stack.png[align=center]


The elastic load balancer will listen on the port `80` for routing traffic to our Kill Bill server instances, and on the port `9090` for accessing KAUI, our admin UI. Internally, both Kill Bill server instances, and KAUI server instances will listen on port `8080`.

The CloudFormation template allows to specify different groups of subnets to isolate the Kill Bill server and KAUI server instances with the RDS instances. Typically one would specify at least 2 subnets, in different availability zones for each of those groups. 

The CloudFormation template will also create individual security groups for the various components:

* LB Security group: Opens ingress `9090`  and `80`, and everything for egress.
* KB Security group: Opens ingress `8080`, and everything for egress.
* RDS Security group: Opens ingress `3306`, and everything for egress.


**Pre-requisites:** The CloudFormation template will require thr following:

* A valid VPC
* A VPC Internet Gateway configured to access all the touside world
* Valid subnets for the VPC as described above

**Example:** Given a VPC with a CIDR of `192.168.0.0/16`

An example of a valid routing table for would be 

|===
|Destination |Target

|192.168.0.0/16
|local

|0.0.0.0/0
|igw-08bbaa2909129b953
|===


Regarding the subnets, the following configuration would work:

* Kill Bill server and KAUI server instances subnets: `192.168.64.0/18` (zone `1e`) and `192.168.192.0/18` (zone `1b`)
* RDS subnets: `192.168.128.0/18` (zone `1e`) and `192.168.0.0/18` (zone `1b`)

=== CloudWatch Integration

Our AMIs come pre-configured with CloudWatch integration to allow for better diagnostics. Below is a screenshot of the metrics that come for free:


image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/aws/cloudwatch.png[align=center]


In order to have business metrics, we also allow to install additional plugins suchs as our free https://github.com/killbill/killbill-analytics-plugin[Analytics plugin]. This provides a subscription billing management solution as feature-rich as popular SaaS platforms, but that you can control. Below is a screenshot of such business metrics:


image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/aws/analytics.png[align=center]


For installation support along the way, reach out to `support@killbill.io`.

=== Configuration Options

The installation supports the following configuration options:

* *VpcId:* the VPC to use for the installation. In your AWS Console, go to *Services* and search for *VPC*. Under *Your VPCs*, locate the VPC ID you would like to use or create a new one.
* *Subnets:* the subnets to use for the KB and KAUi instances. They should be associated with at least two different availability zones. In the VPC Dashboard, go to *Subnets* and find two subnets in your VPC *in two different availability zones*. Alternatively, create new ones (use 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24 as the IPv4 CIDR for instance).
* *RDSSubnets:* the subnets to use for the RDS instance. The RDS instances require a subnet group with at least two different availability zones.
* *KeyName:* name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instances. You can create a new one by going to *Key Pairs* in your EC2 Dashboard.
* *HTTPLocation:* IP address range allowed to access the load balancer (you can always use 0.0.0.0/0 initially and adjust access later on).
* *EnvType:* environment purpose (test, prod, etc.). No difference in the stack being created but stack will send this variable to `CloudWatch` as a dimension.
* *InstanceType:* the EC2 instance type to use for Kill Bill.
* *KillBillServerCapacity:* the initial number of Kill Bill instances in the Auto Scaling group.
* *KauiServerCapacity:* the initial number of Kaui instances in the Auto Scaling group. We recommend using the default value `2`.
* *KBAdminPassword:* the `admin` password that will be used for the default `root` user which has all the permissions. By default such password is set to `password`. Typically, one would use the `root` user to create additional roles (along with their permissions) to limit the scope of what specific applications or users can do. See our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[User Management Documentation].
* *DBClass:* the database instance type to use for RDS.
* *DBName:* database name for Kill Bill. We recommend using the default value *killbill*.
* *KauiDBName:* database name for Kaui. We recommend using the default value *kaui*.
* *DBUser:* database admin username
* *DBPassword:* database admin password
* *EnableCloudWatchMetrics:* whether to record Kill Bill metrics in CloudWatch. Strongly recommended for production. When enabled, a default monitoring dashboard will be created.

=== Setup Steps

1. Start the installation process by going to +++<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nochv5omslmds?ref=_ptnr_doc_" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nochv5omslmds?ref=_ptnr_doc_'); return false;">AWS Marketplace</a>+++: click *Continue to Subscribe* and populate the configuration options in the CloudFormation form.
2. Launch the stack.
3. Upon success, the Outputs tab will display the load balancer URL. Kill Bill is available on port 80 while Kaui on port 9090.

You can log-in to Kaui by going to http://<LOAD_BALANCER_URL>:9090 (make sure your IP address can access the load balancer, as defined by the parameter `HTTPLocation`, or add it to the security group as needed). Default credentials are: *admin/password*.

Take a look at our http://docs.killbill.io/latest/getting_started.html#_using_kill_bill_with_kaui[Getting Started] guide for an introduction to Kaui.

=== TroubleShooting Section

==== Stack Creation

There are a couple of possible issues when starting the stack from CloudFormation (CFN) and so the goal of this section
is to provide some tips debugging the issues, and knowledge about where to find various logs. Also keep in mind
that starting the CFN stack will typically take in the order of 15-20', mostly because of the time it takes to setup the 
RDS cluster, so be patient...


Let's start with the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation[CloudFormation console]: The stack will have a status which will be `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` for the duration of the initialization, and will then either transition to `CREATE_COMPLETE` or `CREATE_FAILED`. In case of `CREATE_FAILED`, try to locate from the `Resources` tab which resource fail to initialize properly.

==== Possible Issues

The main possible issues can be summarized as:

**Issues with the template**

If you think there is an issue with the CFN template itself, please report any issue to `support@killbill.io`

**AWS Errors**

Typical Issues are:

  * Insufficient IAM Permissions
  * Limit Exceeded
  * Security Group Does Not Exist in VPC
  * RDS Cluster failed to come up
  * ...

Make sure to check our `Pre-requisites` section to ensure you have setup a valid VPC with valid subnets. Fow AWS specific issues, please refer to the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[AWS troubleshooting documentation]
    
**Service Unavailable**

We suggest to check the following:

1. Is there any issues reported in the CFN logs
2. Is the database up and running and accessible from the Kill Bill/Kaui ec2 instances?
3. Is the database schema correctly installed?
4. Is the Kill Bill/Kaui server correctly started and listening to the port `8080`?
5. Are Kill Bill/Kaui server accessible from the LB, respectively on port `80` and `9090`?
6. Are there any errors, stack traces in our logs

==== Practical Tips

**SSH to EC2 Instances**

In order to answer these questions, you will first need to be able to SSH to the EC2 instances:

From the EC2 dashboard, you can locate the instances by filtering on a prefix of the name of your stack, in my case `my-stack`,
and as indicated below you will see the instances for Kill Bill server and KAUI. In the example below we see one of each:


image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/ec2-instances.png[align=center]

You can select one instance and then from the description tag, you will have access to:

1. Public DNS
2. The security group

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/ec2-description.png[align=center]

You will need to first click on the security group link to open the inbound port 22 required for SSH, as shown below:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/security-group.png[align=center]

Then, you can issue the SSH command, by copying the Public DNS from the description tab:

```
# SSH as ubuntu user
> ssh -i  <LOCATION_KEY>/<KEY_NAME>.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC_DNS>
# Move to tomcat user
> sudo su - tomcat
```

**CFN LOGS**


If there are any issue with CFN, it should be available from `/var/log/cfn-init-cmd.log` or `/var/log/cfn-init.log`

Other logs of interest may include:
```
/var/log/cfn-wire.log
/var/log/cloud-init-output.log
/var/log/awslogs.logs
/var/log/xray/xray.log
```

**Kill Bill/KAUI Server Logs**

The Kill Bill/KAUI server logs are located under `/var/lib/tomcat/logs/`, with the main 2 interesting logs being:

* `killbill.out`: All Kill Bill server logs, configured as `INFO` by default
* `kaui.out`: All KAUI server logs, configured as `INFO` by default
* `localhost_access_log...`: Access requests to the servers

The configuration of the logging (log rotation, log level, ...) can be found in `/var/lib/killbill/config/logback.xml`

If you update the `logback.xml` (or any configuration file) you will need to restart the service. In order to restart the service, you can run as `root` the following command:

```
# Restart  killbill server instance
> service killbill restart
# Restart  kaui server instance
> service kaui restart
```

**Access to the Database**

From any Kill Bill EC2 instance, it is possible to access the RDS database. On each node, there is `mysql` client installed
allowing to access the database. The database hostname can be obtained from the CFN Resources screen, or one can also
extract this information from the `killbill.propertes` file:

```
> grep 'org.killbill.dao' /var/lib/killbill/config/killbill.properties 
org.killbill.dao.password=killbill
org.killbill.dao.url=jdbc:mysql:aurora://mystack-test-rdscluster-1qwiqitatcb9m.cluster-cah16olm8gkg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/killbill
org.killbill.dao.user=killbill
```

Based on such info, the following command would allow to get a mysql prompt:

```
> mysql -h mystack-test-rdscluster-1qwiqitatcb9m.cluster-cah16olm8gkg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u killbill -pkillbill killbill
> show tables
> ...
```

**Sevice Health**

Since both Kill Bill/KAUI server listen on port `8080`, one can easily check if the service is running by issuing the following command:

```
telnet 127.0.0.1 8080
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

For the Kill Bill server specifically some useful commands are:


```
# Healthcheck
> curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/healthcheck
```

```
# Check which Kill Bill & plugin versions
> curl -u admin:<KBAdminPassword> http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/nodesInfo | jq

    ]
  }
]
```

=== Upgrade Steps

The Kill Bill core team will provide new AMIs whenever necessary.

Because the CloudFormation from AWS Marketplace will always reflect the latest AMI ids, you can simply update the stack with the latest CloudFormation template and the instances in the AutoScaling groups will be updated automatically.

We strongly recommend to always test the upgrade in a test environment first.

== Default configuration

Either installation method comes with a default configuration to get you started.

A few plugins are also pre-configured, but not installed: all you need to do is head to the Kaui KPM page and select the plugin(s) of your choice to install.

=== Invoice templates

Kill Bill invoices can be rendered as HTML using our https://killbill.github.io/slate/#invoice-render-an-invoice-as-html[render HTML invoice API]. This can be useful for instance to expose the invoices directly to your customer on the billing section of your website.

The default template looks as such:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/invoice_html.png[align=center]

The text can be customized and translated. To do so, create file `InvoiceTranslation_en_US.properties` with the following content (adjust the values on the right side of the `=` sign as needed):

[source,properties]
----
companyName=Acme Corporation
companyAddress=57 Academy Drive
companyCityProvincePostalCode=Oak Creek, WI 53154
companyCountry=US
invoiceTitle=Invoice
invoiceDate=Invoice Date: 
invoiceAmount=Total: 
invoiceAmountPaid=Amount Paid: 
invoiceBalance=Balance: 
invoiceItemServicePeriod=Service Period
invoiceItemDescription=Plan
invoiceItemAmount=Amount
----

and upload it to Kaui by going to your admin tenant page (`InvoiceTranslation`) tab:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/invoice_html_config.png[align=center]

Additional languages can be uploaded for each locale (e.g. specify `fr_FR` for French).

More details are available in our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/internationalization.html[Internationalization] userguide, including how to fully customize the template.

=== Email notifications

==== SMTP configuration

The plugin needs to be configured with an SMTP server to be able to send emails. The easiest to set it up on AWS is with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-smtp.html[SES].

Once you have obtained your credentials, update the plugin configuration:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/email-notifications_config.png[align=center]

==== Templates

The plugin comes with a preconfigured set of email templates.

For instance, this is the email which will be sent when an invoice is generated:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/invoice_email.png[align=center]

This is what the user will receive when a subscription is cancelled:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/cancellation_email.png[align=center]

The default set of translation strings are:

[source,properties]
----
upcomingInvoiceAdditionalMessage=Here's a preview of your upcoming invoice
upcomingInvoiceSubject=Your upcoming invoice
invoiceCreationAdditionalMessage=Thank you for your prompt payment!
invoiceCreationSubject=Your recent invoice
successfulPaymentAdditionalMessage=Thank you for your recent payment!
successfulPaymentSubject=Your recent payment
failedPaymentAdditionalMessage=We were not able to process your payment!
failedPaymentSubject=Your recent payment
paymentRefundAdditionalMessage=Your refund has been processed!
paymentRefundSubject=Your recent payment
companyName=Acme Corporation
companyAddress=57 Academy Drive
companyCityProvincePostalCode=Oak Creek, WI 53154
companyCountry=US
invoicePrefix=INV# 
invoiceTitle=Invoice
invoiceDate=Invoice Date: 
invoiceAmount=Total: 
invoiceAmountPaid=Amount Paid: 
invoiceBalance=Balance: 
invoiceItemServicePeriod=Service Period
invoiceItemDescription=Plan
invoiceItemAmount=Amount
paymentTitle=Payment
paymentDate=Payment Date: 
paymentAmount=Total: 
subscriptionCancellationRequestedAdditionalMessage=The following subscription will be cancelled
subscriptionCancellationRequestedSubject=Your subscription will be cancelled
subscriptionCancellationEffectiveAdditionalMessage=The following subscription has been cancelled
subscriptionCancellationEffectiveSubject=Your subscription has been cancelled
subscriptionTitle=Subscription
subscriptionEndDate=End Date: 
susbscriptionPlan=Plan: 
----

More details on how to update these and update the HTML templates are available in the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin[plugin] documentation.

=== Analytics plugin

The plugin comes with a few pre-configured reports:
