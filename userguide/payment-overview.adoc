Kill Bill has a payment subsystem which offers several APIs:

* payment and refund APIs for recurring billing
* *direct* payment APIs for one-off charges

The former set of APIs is used by the core billing engine to charge for subscriptions, and by Kaui (the Kill Bill Admin UI) to handle refunds, chargebacks, adjustments, etc. for invoices and payments associated with such subscriptions.

The latter set can be used by your application to trigger payments (auth, capture, credit, refund, etc.) by your e-commerce application (e.g. shopping cart). It offers also helpers to create payment forms and redirect URLs in case of hosted payment pages.

Kill Bill, being a generic platform to build billing and payment infrastructures, is agnostic of payment gateways. Instead, it provides a framework to register payment plugins, which in turn implement gateway specific APIs. Those payment plugins must be OSGI compliant plugins. They can be written either in:

* java; in which case they are just a standard OSGI java jar which must register a service implementing the PaymentPluginApi.
* ruby; in which case they must use the killbill gem which provides a jruby bridge between java and ruby. Those plugins must inherit the Payment class to provide the specific plugin code functionality.

The main reason to provide a way to write ruby payment plugins is to be able to reuse the http://activemerchant.org/[ActiveMerchant] gem. We even have a https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-framework-ruby/[generator] to help you generate a payment plugin from an ActiveMerchant implementation.

Check the wiki page https://github.com/killbill/killbill/wiki/Payment-plugins[Payment Plugins] for a community-supported list of already written payment plugins.

The Kill Bill payment code will detect all the payment plugins registered in the system and decide which plugin to use when a charge, refund, ... operation needs to happen. The dispatching is based on the payment methods associated with each account. By default, the model is to attach a default payment method to each account and that payment method will have a link that points to a specific plugin to use. For instance one account could have a Paypal payment method that would point to the paypal plugin. In addition to that direct payment apis also allow to override the payment method that should be used for each payment.

By default Kill Bill does not come configured with any payment plugins per se except for the built-in __EXTERNAL_PAYMENT__, which is used to track payments which occurred outside of Kill Bill. A typical example would be for when a customer pays by check and we want to make sure the invoice balance is set to 0 after receiving the check. A user, represented in Kill Bill as an Account can add as many payment methods as required, and each of those will identify a specific plugin that Kill Bill will use when making payments.
