=== Overview

The payment flows can be modified at runtime using a Control Plugin.

Control plugins implement the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-api/blob/master/control/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/control/plugin/api/PaymentControlPluginApi.java[PaymentControlPluginApi] and are invoked before as well as after the payment (either on success or failure). These plugins can be used to abort a payment (e.g. fraud detection), schedule retries in case of failures, etc.

To invoke a control plugin, simply pass the property *controlPluginName* when triggering the payment (multiple control plugins can be invoked in a pipeline). Kill Bill will create a payment attempt associated with that transaction (there is a 1-1 mapping between attempts and payment transactions), and store the plugin name(s) and properties which are used for retries (any plugin that sets a retry date is responsible to correctly remove sensitive information such as CVV, to avoid storing them on disk).
