= Kill Bill on AWS

== Introduction

The core development team publishes official images on the AWS Marketplace, which lets you quickly get started with Kill Bill in the cloud.

== Installation via Our Standalone AMI

Running Kill Bill on AWS using our official AMI lets you deploy Kill Bill, Kaui and MySQL in a single EC2 instance. It is perfect for test environments or for small production deployments where high availability isn't a concern.

=== Setup Steps

1. Start the installation process by going to +++<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B083LYVG9H?ref=_ptnr_doc_" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B083LYVG9H?ref=_ptnr_doc_'); return false;">AWS Marketplace</a>+++: click *Continue to Subscribe* and accept Terms.
2. After a few minutes, click *Continue to Configuration* and *Continue to Launch*
3. Upon success, once the instance is running, Kill Bill is running on port 8443 and Kaui on port 443.

You can log-in to Kaui by going to https://<INSTANCE_IP_>:443 (make sure your IP address can address this port, or add it to the security group as needed). Default credentials are: *admin/password*. The first few requests might be a bit slow as Kill Bill initializes itself.

Take a look at our http://docs.killbill.io/latest/getting_started.html#_using_kill_bill_with_kaui[Getting Started] guide for an introduction to Kaui.

=== Configuration

Kill Bill global properties are defined in `/var/lib/killbill/config/killbill.properties`. This is where you can change the MySQL credentials for instance. Take a look at our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html[configuration guide] for more details.

This is also where you can change the default Kill Bill admin credentials: specify `org.killbill.security.shiroResourcePath=/var/lib/killbill/config/shiro.ini` and create the `shiro.ini` file accordingly (see our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[RBAC guide] for more details).

=== Upgrade steps

Note: you must switch to the `tomcat` user first in order to upgrade Kill Bill or Kaui (`sudo su - tomcat`).

The configuration file `/var/lib/killbill/kpm.yml` specifies the Kill Bill version (and its plugins) running on the instance. After updating this file with the new version(s), simply execute `$KPM_INSTALL_KB_CMD`, delete the cached directory `/var/lib/tomcat/webapps/ROOT` and restart the instance.

A similar process can be used for Kaui: update `/var/lib/kaui/kpm.yml`, run `$KPM_INSTALL_KAUI_CMD`, delete the cached directory `/var/lib/tomcat/webapps2/ROOT` and restart the instance.

== Installation via CloudFormation

The Standalone AMIs are very convenient to start a full stack on ONE EC2 instance, but for production deployments, we suggest to use our CloudFormation tempate to start a fully redundant stack.

=== Overview of the Stack

Running Kill Bill on AWS using our +++<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nochv5omslmds?ref=_ptnr_doc_" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nochv5omslmds?ref=_ptnr_doc_'); return false;">official CloudFormation template</a>+++ is the easiest and fastest way to get started with a production cluster. *It is also the only method of installation that is certified by the core developers for a Highly Available, horizontally scalable and production-ready installation.*

With the click of a button, the template will install and configure:

* Kill Bill and Kaui on a custom AMI optimized for AWS workloads (integrated with CloudWatch, SQS, SES, X-Ray and more)
* Auto Scaling Groups, to automatically scale up and down the number of instances as needed (such as when batches of invoices are generated)
* A load balancer, integrated with our internal healthchecks to promptly take out of rotation unhealthy instances
* A RDS Aurora Cluster with automatic failover


The following diagram shows the various AWS entities that will be created by CloudFormation:

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/aws/cf_stack.png[align=center]


The elastic load balancer will listen on the port `80` for routing traffic to our Kill Bill server instances, and on the port `9090` for accessing KAUI, our admin UI. Internally, both Kill Bill server instances, and KAUI server instances will listen on port `8080`.

The CloudFormation template allows to specify different groups of subnets to isolate the Kill Bill server and KAUI server instances with the RDS instances. Typically one would specify at least 2 subnets, in different availability zones for each of those groups. 

The CloudFormation template will also create individual security groups for the various components:

* LB Security group: Opens ingress `9090`  and `80`, and everything for egress.
* KB Security group: Opens ingress `8080`, and everything for egress.
* RDS Security group: Opens ingress `3306`, and everything for egress.


**Pre-requisites:** The CloudFormation template will require thr following:

* A valid VPC
* A VPC Internet Gateway configured to access all the touside world
* Valid subnets for the VPC as described above

**Example:** Given a VPC with a CIDR of `192.168.0.0/16`

An example of a valid routing table for would be 

|===
|Destination |Target

|192.168.0.0/16
|local

|0.0.0.0/0
|igw-08bbaa2909129b953
|===


Regarding the subnets, the following configuration would work:

* Kill Bill server and KAUI server instances subnets: `192.168.64.0/18` (zone `1e`) and `192.168.192.0/18` (zone `1b`)
* RDS subnets: `192.168.128.0/18` (zone `1e`) and `192.168.0.0/18` (zone `1b`)


=== CloudWatch Integration

Our AMIs come pre-configured with CloudWatch integration to allow for better diagnostics. Below is a screenshot of the metrics that come for free:

In order to have business metrics, we also allow to install additional plugins suchs as our free https://github.com/killbill/killbill-analytics-plugin[Analytics plugin]. This provides a subscription billing management solution as feature-rich as popular SaaS platforms, but that you can control. Below is a screenshot of such business metrics:

For installation support along the way, reach out to `support@killbill.io`.

=== Configuration Options

The installation supports the following configuration options:

* *VpcId:* the VPC to use for the installation. In your AWS Console, go to *Services* and search for *VPC*. Under *Your VPCs*, locate the VPC ID you would like to use or create a new one.
* *Subnets:* the subnets to use for the KB and KAUi instances. They should be associated with at least two different availability zones. In the VPC Dashboard, go to *Subnets* and find two subnets in your VPC *in two different availability zones*. Alternatively, create new ones (use 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24 as the IPv4 CIDR for instance).
* *RDSSubnets:* the subnets to use for the RDS instance. The RDS instances require a subnet group with at least two different availability zones.
* *KeyName:* name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to enable SSH access to the instances. You can create a new one by going to *Key Pairs* in your EC2 Dashboard.
* *HTTPLocation:* IP address range allowed to access the load balancer (you can always use 0.0.0.0/0 initially and adjust access later on).
* *EnvType:* environment purpose (test, prod, etc.)
* *InstanceType:* the EC2 instance type to use for Kill Bill. Here are some guidelines:
** `t2.medium` -> `t2.xlarge`: test environment
** `m5.large`: up to 5,000 subscriptions
** `c5.2xlarge`: up to 50,000 subscriptions
** `c5.4xlarge`: beyond 50,000 subscriptions
* *KillBillServerCapacity:* the initial number of Kill Bill instances in the Auto Scaling group. Here are some guidelines:
** `1`: test environment
** `2`: up to 5,000 subscriptions
** `3`: up to 50,000 subscriptions
** `4`: beyond 50,000 subscriptions
* *KauiServerCapacity:* the initial number of Kaui instances in the Auto Scaling group. We recommend using the default value `2`.
* *KBAdminPassword:* the `admin` password that will be used for the default `root` user which has all the permissions. By default such password is set to `password`. Typically, one would use the `root` user to create additional roles (along with their permissions) to limit the scope of what specific applications or users can do. See our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/user_management.html[User Management Documentation].
* *DBClass:* the database instance type to use for RDS. Here are some guidelines:
** `db.t3.medium`: test environment
** `db.r5.xlarge`: up to 5,000 subscriptions
** `db.r5.2xlarge`: up to 50,000 subscriptions
** `db.r5.4xlarge`: beyond 50,000 subscriptions
* *DBName:* database name for Kill Bill. We recommend using the default value *killbill*.
* *KauiDBName:* database name for Kaui. We recommend using the default value *kaui*.
* *DBUser:* database admin username
* *DBPassword:* database admin password
* *EnableCloudWatchMetrics:* whether to record Kill Bill metrics in CloudWatch. Strongly recommended for production. When enabled, a default monitoring dashboard will be created.

=== Setup Steps

1. Start the installation process by going to +++<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nochv5omslmds?ref=_ptnr_doc_" onclick="getOutboundLink('https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nochv5omslmds?ref=_ptnr_doc_'); return false;">AWS Marketplace</a>+++: click *Continue to Subscribe* and populate the configuration options in the CloudFormation form.
2. Launch the stack.
3. Upon success, the Outputs tab will display the load balancer URL. Kill Bill is available on port 80 while Kaui on port 9090.

You can log-in to Kaui by going to http://<LOAD_BALANCER_URL>:9090 (make sure your IP address can access the load balancer, as defined by the parameter `HTTPLocation`, or add it to the security group as needed). Default credentials are: *admin/password*.

Take a look at our http://docs.killbill.io/latest/getting_started.html#_using_kill_bill_with_kaui[Getting Started] guide for an introduction to Kaui.

=== Upgrade Steps

The Kill Bill core team will provide new AMIs whenever necessary.

Because the CloudFormation from AWS Marketplace will always reflect the latest AMI ids, you can simply update the stack with the latest CloudFormation template and the instances in the AutoScaling groups will be updated automatically.

We strongly recommend to always test the upgrade in a test environment first.
