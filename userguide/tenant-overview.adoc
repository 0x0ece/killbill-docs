Kill Bill supports multi-tenancy, meaning you can run multiple logical instances of Kill Bill with a single server and database. For example, say you own two online stores, each of them having different catalogs, users, etc. You could configure a tenant for each of them, which would make the data from one store invisible to the other.

In practice, a tenant is a simple attribute that Kill Bill tracks along each object in the database (accounts, subscriptions, invoices, etc.). When multi-tenancy is enabled, you would create a username/password for each tenant and perform all REST calls using HTTP Basic Auth: Kill Bill would then automatically look up the tenant associated with your username as part of each request.

Multi-tenancy is an advanced feature. You can turn it off by removing the shiro.ini file from the Kill Bill war. We suggest though that it you let it enabled and create a tenant even if you have a single use case for Kill Bill. That way, you will be able to add another tenant if need be later on (going from multi-tenancy disabled to multi-tenancy enabled is much harder and will involve manual and error prone data changes).
