The tables *bin* (Business Invoices), *bia* (Business Invoice Adjustments), *biia* (Business Invoice Item adjustments), *biic* (Business Invoice Item Credits) and *bii* (Business Invoice Items) maintain information about invoices posted by account.

Definitions:

* *invoice_balance*: invoice_amount_charged + invoice_amount_credited + invoice_amount_adjusted_for_account_credit - (invoice_amount_paid + invoice_amount_refunded)
* *invoice_amount_charged*: sum of all bii, bia and biia items for that invoice
* *invoice_amount_credited*: sum of all biic items for that invoice (positive if granted, negative if used)
* *invoice_amount_paid*: sum of all bip items for that invoice
* *invoice_amount_refunded*: sum of all bipc and bipr items for that invoice
* *invoice_original_amount_charged*: sum of all bii items for that invoice at the time of invoice cre

Note that *invoice_amount_adjusted_for_account_credit* is an internal adjustment that applies for account level credits only (CREDIT_ADJ items on their own invoices) and is not represented in Analytics. The full details of the computations can be found in https://github.com/killbill/killbill/blob/master/invoice/src/main/java/com/ning/billing/invoice/calculator/InvoiceCalculatorUtils.java[InvoiceCalculatorUtils.java].

A few remarks:

* EXTERNAL_CHARGE, FIXED and RECURRING items are treated as regular line items (stored in bii)
* ITEM_ADJ items are treated as invoice item adjustments (stored in biia)
* CBA_ADJ items (gained or consumed) are treated as account credits (stored in biic)
* REFUND_ADJ items are treated as invoice adjustments (stored in bia)
* CREDIT_ADJ items that are not on their own invoice are treated as invoice adjustments (stored in bia). The internal name of CREDIT_ADJ is misleading in this case and will probably be renamed to INVOICE_ADJ in a future release. Note that these should not be mixed with account level credits: when an administrator creates an account credit (different from CBA credits generated by the system), a negative CREDIT_ADJ item is added to a new invoice. This triggers a positive CBA_ADJ item (to bring the balance back to zero), which effectively becomes the account credit (and eventually stored in biic). In this case, the CREDIT_ADJ item will not be stored directly in the analytics tables
* Kill Bill repair items (REPAIR_ADJ) are not stored directly in any of these tables, but are combined with the new reparee item as invoice item adjustments (in biia). For example, if a recurring item of $20 was repaired into a $5 recurring item, bii would contain the original $20 line item and biia would contain a $-15 adjustment item
* Any invoice item has a revenue recognizable attribute which is used to tell if the item is recognizable from a finance perspective (tied to cash). This is used for credits only today and we assume that any administrator generated credit (CREDIT_ADJ and CBA_ADJ on their own invoice) is not recognizable. All other credit items, including system generated ones, are.
