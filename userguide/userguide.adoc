== Deployment

When deploying Kill Bill to a production environment, you'll likely want to use your own container and deploy Kill Bill as a war. Below are instructions for various containers. If you're unsure which one to use and/or don't have any preference, we recommend Jetty.

=== Common steps

==== Download the latest version of Kill Bill server

Releases are available in Maven Central. Among other packaging formats, we provide a war with all dependencies. You can get the latest version http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.ning.billing%22%20AND%20a%3A%22killbill-server%22[here] (download the *jar-with-dependencies.war* artifact).

==== Setup the database

Create the database killbill will use and apply the latest DDL schema, which can be generated via:

[source,ruby]
----
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL http://kill-bill.org/schema)" > ddl.sql
----
