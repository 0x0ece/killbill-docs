Kill Bill offers the ability to tag resources (account, invoice, payment, subscription, ...) in the system. There are two main types of tags:

* `User tags`: Those tags are not interpreted by the system; there are a convininent way for admins, third party system to annotate specific existing resources. For instance, the support team could tag account resource associated with specific customer to group them.
* `Control tags`: Those tags are interpreted to modify the behavior of the system:
** AUTO_PAY_OFF: This tag can only be associated to an account, and when set it means that the system will not attempt to trigger automatic payments after invoices have been generated. After this tag has been removed, the system will immediately attempt to issue the payments that were not made.
** AUTO_INVOICING_OFF: This tag can only be associated to an account, and when set it means that the system will not attempt to invoice the customer. After this tag has been removed, the system will immediately attempt to issue invoice the account.
** OVERDUE_ENFORCEMENT_OFF: This tag can only be associated to an account, and when set it means that the system will not attempt transition the account into an overdue state regardless of his potential failed payments. After this tag has been removed, the system will immediately recompute the current overdue state.
** MANUAL_PAY: This tag can only be associated to an account, and when set it means that the system will not attempt to trigger automatic payments after invoices have been generated. The intent here is to have the customer make his payment outside of Kill Bill.
** WRITTEN_OFF: This tag can only be associated to a specific invoice in such a way that it its balance is ignore by the system.
** TEST: This tag can only be associated to an account, and it is used by analytics plugin so as to not be included set of accounts.
** PARTNER: This tag can only be associated to an account, and it is used by analytics plugin so as to be interpreted differently.
