=== Custom Plugin

In order to customize the system further, one can write a plugin that will listen to Overdue events. Examples of such plugins can be found here:

* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldListener.java [Java plugin]
* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-ruby-plugin/blob/master/lib/helloworld/user_listener.rb [Ruby plugin]

The plugin would need to filter for `OVERDUE_CHANGE` https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-api/blob/master/notification/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/notification/plugin/api/ExtBusEventType.java[events]

Such plugins can be used for the following purpose:

* Email/Notifiy user about the new state
* Take action to modify the experience (based on the state name), for instance to degrade the service, or modify the login flow on a website to prompt for payments, ...
