Kill Bill, as a system, is composed of several components:

* The core billing platform itself, which is embedded in a web server to offer a REST api. When we refer to Kill Bill in that documentation this is what we are referring to, unless explicitly specified
* KAUI, the Kill Bill Admin UI, which is a Rails mountable engine, and communicates to the core billing platform using the REST api
* A set of client libraries (Java, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, ...)

Let's go through a common (web) use case of Kill Bill. One would create a custom webapp, which would contain the application's specific business logic, and have that webapp interact with Kill Bill using the REST API. In that use case, the custom webapp would:

* Offer a way for customers to select a plan from the Kill Bill catalog, which would result in the creation of a Subscription in Kill Bill
* Offer a form for customers to enter their CC information -- or any other payment method. The flow differs depending on the payment gateway and PCI compliance needs
* Offer a way for customers to review/change their subscriptions
* Offer a way for customers to review/change their payment methods

It is important to understand that Kill Bill solves the billing problem but not the custom flow required around the billing platform. Besides the main use case described above, there are other possible options if one requires going that path:

* One could embed its webapp specific code inside Kill Bill, and therefore avoid having a separate web app.
* Another use case would be to embed Kill Bill into the custom web app: Below the REST API, Kill Bill offers a set of Java APIs, and so it is possible to use Kill Bill as a billing library.
