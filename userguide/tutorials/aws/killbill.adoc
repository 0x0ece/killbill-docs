At this stage you have both a dockerized instance of EC2 running and an RDS instance. We need to setup the database and start Kill Bill. Also, and as an example we will deploy the stripe plugin along with Kill Bill.

Note: *Replace the DNS names below in the rest of the doc with your RDS and EC2 DNS name*

Since the RDS instance is not publicly available, we will configure it through our EC2 instance, so first we will need to ssh to the EC2 instance:

[source,bash]
.SSH to the zone:
----
> chmod 400 docker.pem # make sure private key is read-only
> ssh  -i dockerdemo.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-174-176-179.compute-1.amazonaws.com
----


[source,bash]
.Also verify that dockerd is running:
----
> ps -ef | grep dockerd # Or:
> sudo docker info
----
