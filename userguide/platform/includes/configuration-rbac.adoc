Kill Bill implements role-based access control (RBAC) for authentication and authorization. While the concept of users and roles are expected to be managed outside of Kill Bill, a set of permissions are defined and enforced at the library API level. The full set of permissions can be found https://raw.github.com/killbill/killbill-api/master/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/security/Permission.java[here].

Kill Bill expects a Realm to contain the mapping of users and roles, as well as roles and permissions. You can configure these in an ini file, for example:

[source,ini]
----
# Passwords can be encrypted, see http://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html#Configuration-EncryptingPasswords
[users]
admin = password, root
bob = password, finance
sarah = password, support

[roles]
root = *:*
finance = invoice:*, payment:*
support = entitlement:*, invoice:item_adjust, payment:refund
----

Specify the path to this file via *-Dorg.killbill.security.shiroResourcePath=/var/tmp/security.ini*.

Alternatively, you can connect your LDAP instance to Kill Bill. See https://raw.github.com/killbill/killbill/master/util/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/util/config/SecurityConfig.java[SecurityConfig.java] for configuration options.

RBAC is enabled by default, with a single admin user defined (username *admin*, password *password*).
